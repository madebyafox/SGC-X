# SGC X 

Important Changes from SGC3A/B prior to winter 2022
- upgraded to new version of jsPsych (v7) with multiple API changes 
- moved most condition-contingent logic out of stimulus and graphs.js into experiment.js
- pass data to stimulus.html via a hidden <data> element that populates based on data: in trial, based on customized version of external-html plugin (customized by me:)
