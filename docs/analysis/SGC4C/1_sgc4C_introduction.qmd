**TODO UPDATE**

**In Study 4C we explore the extent to which the orientation of the axes in space influence how a reader interprets its underlying coordinate system.**

### Hypotheses

**Experimental Hypothesis:**\
*We hypothesize that the design of the MARK that represents an individual data point can also influence the interpretation of the coordinate system, even though it does not explicitly represent any aspect of the coordinate system, and that is not the function of the mark in the graphical framework. Marks can provide visual cues that direct the reader toward more appropriate interpretations.*

-   H1 The ARROW condition should yield significantly better performance
    -   H1A \| ARROW condition should yield higher total absolute score
    -   H1B \| ARROW condition should yield higher first question score
    -   H1C \| ARROW condition should yield lower response times on the first question (both overall, and specifically among participants who answer correctly)
-   H2 \| The CROSS condition should not yield significantly better performance
    -   H2A \| No difference in overall performance between POINT and CROSS
    -   H2B \| No difference in first question score between POINT and CROSS
    -   H2C \| No difference in response latency between POINT and CROSS

## METHODS

### Design

We employed a mixed design with 1 between-subjects factor with 3 levels (Mark: POINT, CROSS, ARROW) and 15 items (within-subjects factor).

Independent Variables:

-   B-S (Mark Design: Point, Arrow, Cross )
-   W-S (Item x 15)

Dependent Variables:

-   Response Accuracy : Is the response triangular-correct?
-   Response Interpretation : (derived) With which interpretation of the graph is the subject's response on an individual question consistent?
-   Response Latency : Time from stimulus onset to clicking 'Submit' button: time in (s)

### Materials

Stimuli consisted of a series of 15 graph comprehension questions, each testing a different combination of time interval relations, to be read from a Triangular-Model graph. @fig-sample. The list of questions can be found [here](static/stimuli/sgcx_questions.csv).

In each experimental

### Procedure

Participants completed the study via a web-browser.

\(1\) Upon starting, they submitted informed consent, before reading task instructions.

\(2\) Participants were introduced to a scenario in which they were to play the role of a project manager, scheduling shifts for a group of employees. The schedule of the employees was presented in a Triangular Model (TM) graph, and they would be answering question about the schedule.

\(3\) Then participants completed an experimental block of 15 items: The Graph Comprehension Task.

\(4\) Following the experimental block, participants answered a free-response question about their strategy for reading the graph, followed by a demographic questionnaire and debrief.

### Sample

Data were collected by convenience sample of a university subject pool during the winter of 2022. Participants accessed the study via a web browser (asynchronously). The stimulus application required the participant stay in full-screen mode for the entirety of the study.

## ANALYSIS

### Data Preparation {#sec-SGC4C-harmonize}

Data were collected via a custom web application and stored in a NoSQL database. The following exclusion criteria were applied during data cleaning:

-   completion status : "success" ; subject must have finished all parts of the study, including demographic questionnaire
-   session ID: \[in list\] ; subject must have been assigned to valid data collection session (discard testing and piloting data)
-   browser interaction violations \< 3; subject must have fewer than 3 violations of non-allowed browser interactions (i.e. resizing window, leaving browser tab or leaving fullscreen mode)
-   self-rated effort \> 2; subjects who reported, "not trying hard/rushing through questions" or "started out trying hard but giving up at some point" were excluded from analysis.
-   attention check ==TRUE ; subjects who failed to answer a mid-study attention check question (Graph Comprehension Task Question #6) are excluded

The underlying data structure of the stimulus web application changed across the data collection period, resulting in slightly different data files (i.e. columns are not named consistently). In this section, we combine the files from each data collection period into a single *harmonized* data file for analysis (one for participants, one for items).

#### Participants

First we import participant-level data, selecting only the columns relevant for analysis. The result is a single data frame `df_subjects` containing one row for each subject (across all periods). Note that we *are not* discarding any *response* data. Rather, we discard columns that are automatically recorded by the stimulus web application and help the application run.

*Note that we discard some columns representing scores calculated in the stimulus engine. These scores were calculated differently across collection periods, and so we discard them and recalculate scores in the next analysis notebook. No raw data (responses and response times) are discarded, only algorithmically-derived scores for the responses.*

#IMPORT PARTICIPANT DATA

# HACK WD FOR LOCAL RUNNING?
#imac = "/Users/amyraefox/Code/SGC-Scaffolding_Graph_Comprehension/SGC-X/ANALYSIS/MAIN"
# mbp = "/Users/amyfox/Sites/RESEARCH/SGC—Scaffolding Graph Comprehension/SGC-X/ANALYSIS/MAIN"
#setwd(imac)

#import file
df_subjects <- read_rds("analysis/SGC4C/data/0-session-level/sgc4c_participants.rds") #use RDS file as it contains metadata

#NO EXPLANATION COLUMN IN SGC4c DATASET; TRIAL NOT COLLECTED 
#save 'explanation' columns from winter22, which is actually a response to a free response item (Q16); was recorded with item_level data in old webapp
# df_q16 <- df_subjects %>% 
#   select(subject, condition, term , mode, explanation) %>% 
#   mutate(
#     q = 16,
#     response = explanation
#   ) %>% select(-explanation)

#reduce data collected using NEW webapp to useful columns
#drop absolute score because we rescore in 2_scoring
df_subjects <- df_subjects %>% 
  #select only columns we'll be analyzing, discard others
  dplyr::select( subject, condition, pretty_condition, study, term, mode, 
                 #demographics
                 gender, age, language, schoolyear, country,
                 #effort survey
                 effort, difficulty, confidence, enjoyment, 
                 #explanations

                 #response characteristics
                 totaltime_m,
                 #exploratory factors
                 violations, browser, width, height
                 )


effort_labels <- c("I tried my best on each question", "I tried my best on most questions")

#set factors
df_subjects <- df_subjects %>% 
  #refactor factors
  mutate (
    subject = factor(subject),
    condition = factor(condition),
    term = factor(term),
    mode = factor(mode),
    gender = factor(gender),
    schoolyear = factor(schoolyear, levels=c("First","Second","Third","Fourth","Fifth","Other"))
  )

```

#### Items

Next we import item-level data from each data collection period, selecting only the columns relevant for analysis. The result is a single data frame `df_items` containing one row for each *graph comprehension task question* (qs=15) (across all periods). A second data frame `df_freeresponse` contains one row for each free response strategy question (last question posed to participants in Winter2022) Note that we *do not* discard any *response* data. Rather, we *do* discard several columns representing accuracy scores for responses that were calculated in the stimulus engine. These scores were calculated differently across collection periods, and so we discard them and recalculate scores in the next analysis notebook. Original response data are always preserved.

```{r}
#| label: IMPORT-ITEMS
#| message: false

# HACK WD FOR LOCAL RUNNING?
#imac = "/Users/amyraefox/Code/SGC-Scaffolding_Graph_Comprehension/SGC-X/ANALYSIS/MAIN"
# mbp = "/Users/amyfox/Sites/RESEARCH/SGC—Scaffolding Graph Comprehension/SGC-X/ANALYSIS/MAIN"
#setwd(imac)

#read datafiles
df_items <- read_rds("analysis/SGC4C/data/0-session-level/sgc4c_items.rds") #use RDS file as it contains metadata

#reduce data collected using new webapp
df_items <- df_items %>% 
  select(subject, condition, pretty_condition, study, term, mode, question, q, answer, correct, rt_s) %>% #unfactor before combine
  mutate(
    subject = as.character(subject),
    condition = as.character(condition),
    term = as.character(term),
    mode = as.character(mode),
    q = as.integer(q),
    correct = as.logical(correct)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = str_remove_all(as.character(answer), ","),
    num_o = str_length(response)
  )%>% 
  # handle NA values (why are some empty responses blank and others NA?) 
  mutate(
    response = replace_na(response, ""),
    num_o = replace_na(num_o, 0)
  )

```

#### Validation

Next, we validate that we have the complete number of item-level records based on the number of subject-level records

```{r}
#| label: RECONCILE

#the number of items should be equal to 15 x the number of subjects
nrow(df_items) == 15* nrow(df_subjects) #TRUE

#each subject should have 15 items
df_items %>% group_by(subject) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% filter(n != 15) %>% nrow() == 0

```

#### Export

Finally, we export the (session-harmonized) data for analysis, as CSVs, and .RDS (includes metadata)

```{r}
#| label: EXPORT-FILES

#setwd(imac)

#SAVE FILES
write.csv(df_subjects,"analysis/SGC4C/data/1-study-level/sgc4c_participants.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(df_items,"analysis/SGC4C/data/1-study-level/sgc4c_items.csv", row.names = FALSE)
