    "text": "2.1 MULTIPLE RESPONSE SCORING\nThe graph comprehension task of study SGC 3A presents readers with a graph, a question, and a series of checkboxes. Participants are instructed to use the graph to answer the question, and respond by selecting all the checkboxes that apply, where each checkbox corresponds to a datapoint in the graph.\n\n\nFigure 1. Sample Graph Comprehension (Question # 6)\n\n\nIn the psychology and education literatures on Tests & Measures, the format of this type of question is referred to as Multiple Response (MR), (also: Multiple Choice Multiple Answer (MCMA) and Multiple Answer Multiple Choice (MAMC)). It has a number of properties that make it different from traditional Single Answer Multiple Choice (SAMC) questions, where the respondent marks a single response from a number of options. In particular, there are a number of very different ways that MAMC questions can be scored.\nIn tranditional SAMC format questions, one point is given for selecting the option designated as correct, and zero points given for marking any of the alternative (i.e. distractor) options. Individual response options on MAMC questions, however might be partially correct (\\(i\\)), while responses on other answer options within the same item might be incorrect (\\(n – i\\)). In MR, it is not obvious how to allocate points when the respondent marks a true-correct option (i.e. options that should be selected, denoted \\(p\\)), as well as one or more false-correct options (i.e. options that should not be selected, denoted \\(q\\)). Should partial credit be awarded? If so, are options that respondents false-selected and false-unselected items equally penalized?\nSchmidt et al. (2021) performed a systematic literature review of publications proposing MAMC (or equivalent) scoring schemes, ultimately synthesizing over 80 sources into 27 distinct scoring approaches. Upon reviewing the benefits of trade-offs of each approach, for this study we choose utilize two of the schemes: dichotomous scoring ( Schmidt et al. (2021) scheme #1), and partial scoring \\([-1/q,0, +1/p]\\) ( Schmidt et al. (2021) scheme #26), as well as a scaled discriminant score that leverages partial scoring to discriminate between strategy-specific patterns of response.\n\n2.1.1 Response Encoding\nFirst, we note that the question type evaluated by Schmidt et al. (2021) is referred to as Multiple True-False (MTF), a variant of MAMC where respondents are presented with a question (stem) and series of response options with True/False (e.g. radio buttons) for each. Depending on the implementation of the underlying instrument, it may or may not be possible for respondents to not respond to a particular option (i.e. leave the item ‘blank’). Although MTF questions have a different underlying implementation (and potentially different psychometric properties) they are identical in their mathematical properties; that is, responses to a MAMC question of ‘select all that apply’ can be coded as a series of T/F responses to each response option\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Figure 2. SAMC (vs) MAMC (vs) MTF\n\n\nIn this example (Figure 2.1), we see an example of a question with four response options (\\(n=4\\)) in each question type. In the SAMC approach (at left), there are four possible responses, given explicitly by the response options (respondent can select only one) \\((\\text{number of possible responses} = n)\\). With only four possible responses, we cannot entirely discriminate between all combinations of the underlying response variants we might be interested in, and must always choose an ‘ideal subset’ of possible distractors to present as response options. In the MAMC (middle) and MTF (at right), the same number of response options (\\(n=4\\)) yield a much greater number \\((\\text{number of possible responses} = 2^{n})\\). We can also see the equivalence between a MAMC and MTF format questions with the same response options. Options the respondent selects in MAMC are can be coded as T, and options they leave unselected can be coded as F. Thus, for response options (ABCD), a response of [AB] can also be encoded as [TTFF].\n\n2.1.2 Scoring Schemes\nIn the sections that follow, we use the terminology:\nProperties of the Stimulus-Question\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nn &= \\text{number of response options} \\\\  \n  &= p + q \\\\\n  p &= \\text{number of true-select options (i.e. should be selected)} \\\\\n  q &= \\text{number of true-unselect options (i.e. should not be selected)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nProperties of the Subject’s Response\n\\[\n  \\begin{align}\ni &= \\text{number of options in correct state}, (0 ≤ i ≤ n) \\\\\nf &= \\text{resulting score}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n2.1.2.1 Dichotomous Scoring\nDichotomous Scoring is the strictest scoring scheme, where a response only receives points if it is exactly correct, meaning the respondent includes only correct-select options, and does select any additional (i.e. incorrect-select) options that should not be selected. This is also known as all or nothing scoring, and importantly, it ignores any partial knowledge that a participant may be expressing through their choice of options. They may select some but not all of the correct-select options, and one or more but not all of the correct-unselect items, but receive the same score as a respondent selects none of the correct-select options, or all of the correct-unselect options. In this sense, dichotomous scoring tells us only about perfect knowledge, and ignores any indication of partial knowledge the respondent may be indicating through their selection of response options.\nIn Dichotomous Scoring\n\nscore for the question is either 0 or 1\nfull credit is only given if all responses are correct; otherwise no credit\ndoes not account for partial knowledge. - with increasing number of response options, scoring becomes stricter as each statement must be marked correctly.\n\nThe algorithm for dichotomous scoring is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{gather*}\nf =\n\\begin{cases}\n  1, \\text{if } i = n \\\\    \n  0, \\text{otherwise}    \n\\end{cases}\n\\end{gather*}\n\\tag{1}\n\\text{where } 0 \\le i \\le n\n\\]\n\nCODEf_dichom <- function(i, n) {\n \n  # print(paste(\"i is :\",i,\" n is:\",n)) \n  \n  #if (n == 0 ) return error \n  ifelse( (n == 0), print(\"ERROR n can't be 0\"), \"\")\n  \n  #if (i > n ) return error \n  ifelse( (i > n), print(\"i n can't > n\"), \"\")\n  \n  #if (i==n) return 1, else 0\n  return (ifelse( (i==n), 1 , 0))\n \n}\n\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Partial Scoring [-1/n, +1/n]\nPartial Scoring refers to a class or scoring schemes that award the respondent partial credit depending on pattern of options they select. Schmidt et al. (2021) identify twenty-six different partial credit scoring schemes in the literature, varying in the range of possible scores, and the relative weighting of incorrectly selected (vs) incorrectly unselected options.\nA particularly elegant approach to partial scoring is referred to as the \\([-1/n, +1/n]\\) approach ( Schmidt et al. (2021) #17). This approach is appealing in the context of SGC3A, because it: (1) takes into account all information provided by the respondent: the pattern of what the select, and choose not to select.\nIn Partial Scoring \\([-1/n, +1/n]\\):\n\nScores range from [-1, +1]\nOne point is awarded if all options are correct\n\nOne point point is subtracted if all options are incorrect.\nIntermediate results are credited as fractions accordingly (\\(+1/n\\) for each correct, \\(-1/n\\) for each incorrect)\nThis results in at chance performance (i.e. half of the given options marked correctly), being awarded 0 points are awarded\n\nThis scoring is more consistent with the motivating theory that Triangular Graph readers start out with an incorrect (i.e. orthogonal, cartesian) interpretation of the coordinate system, and transition to a correct (i.e. triangular) interpretation. But the first step in making this transition is realizing the cartesian interpretation is incorrect, which may yield blank responses where the respondent is essentially saying, ‘there is no correct answer to this question’.\nSchmidt et al. (2021) describe the Partial \\({[-1/n, +1/n]}\\) scoring scheme as the only scoring method (of the 27 described) where respondents’ scoring results can be interpreted as a percentage of their true knowledge. One important drawback of this method is that a respondent may receive credit (a great deal of credit, depending on the number of answer options n) even if she did not select any options. In the case (such as ours) where there are many more response options \\(n\\) than there are options meant to be selected \\(p\\), this partial scoring algorithm poses a challenge because the respondent can achieve an almost completely perfect score by selecting a small number of options that should not be selected.\nThe algorithm for partial scoring\\([-1/n, +1/n]\\) is given by:\n\\[\n  \\begin{align}\nf &= (1/n * i) - (1/n * (n-i)) \\\\\n&= (2i - n)/{n}\n\\tag{2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nCODEf_partialN <- function(i, n) {\n\n# print(paste(\"i is :\",i,\" n is:\",n))\n\n#if(n==0) return error\nifelse((n==0),print(\"ERROR: n should not be 0\"),\"\")\n\n#if(i >n ) return error\nifelse((i > n),print(\"ERROR: i CANNOT BE GREATER THAN n\"),\"\")\n\nreturn ((2*i - n) / n) \n}\n\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Partial Scoring [-1/p, +1/p]\nOne drawback of the Partial Scoring \\([-1/n, +1/n]\\) approach is that treats the choice to select, and choice to not select options as equally indicative of the respondent’s understanding. That is to say, incorrectly selecting one particular option is no more or less informative than incorrectly not-selecting a different item. This represents an important difference between MAMC (i.e. “select all correct options”) vs MTF (i.e. “Mark each option as true or false”) questions.\nIn our study, the selection of any particular option (remember options represent data points on the stimulus graph) is indicative of a particular interpretation of the stimulus. Incorrectly selecting an option indicates an interpretation of the graph with respect to that particular option. Alternatively, failing to select a correct option might mean the individual has a different interpretation, or that they failed to find all the data points consistent with the interpretation.\nFor this reason, we consider another alternative Partial Scoring scheme that takes into consideration only the selected statements, without penalizing statements incorrectly not selected. (See Schmidt et al. (2021) method #26; also referred to as the Morgan-Method) This partial scoring scheme takes into consideration that the most effort-free (or ‘default’) response for any given item is the null, or blank response. Blank responses indicate no understanding, perhaps confusion, or refusal to answer. These lack of responses are awarded zero credit. Whereas taking the action to select an incorrect option is effortful, and is indicative of incorrect understanding.\nPartial Scoring \\([-1/q, +1/p]\\):\n\nawards +1/p for each correctly selected option (\\(p_s\\)), and subtracts \\(1/(n-p) = 1/q\\) for each incorrectly selected option (\\(q_s\\))\nonly considers selected options; does not penalize nor reward unselected options\n\nProperties of Item\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np &= \\text{number of true-select options (i.e. should be selected)} \\\\\nq &= \\text{number of true-unselect options (i.e. should not be selected)} \\\\\nn &= \\text{number of options} \\: ( n = p + q)\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nProperties of Response\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np_s &= \\text{number of true-select options selected (i.e. number of correctly checked options)}\\\\\nq_s &= \\text{number of true-unselect options selected (i.e. number of incorrectly checked options }\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe algorithm for partial scoring \\([-1/q, +1/p]\\) is given by:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nf &= (p_m / p) - ({q_m}/{q}) \\\\\n\\tag{3}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nCODEf_partialP <- function(t,p,f,q) {\n\n  #t = number of correct-selected options\n  #p = number of true options\n  #f = number of incorrect-selected options\n  #q = number of false options\n  #n = number of options + p + q\n  ifelse( (p == 0), return(\"\"), \"\") #handle empty response set gracefully by returning nothing\n  ifelse( (p != 0), return( (t / p) - (f/q)), \"\")\n  \n  # return( (t / p) - (f/q))\n}\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Comparison of Schemes\nWhich scoring scheme is most appropriate for the goals of the graph comprehension task?\nConsider the following example:\nFor a question with \\(n = 5\\) response options (data points A, B, C, D and E) with a correct response of A, the schemes under consideration yield the following scores:\n\nCODEtitle <- \"Comparison of Scoring Schemes for n = 5 options [ A,B,C,D,E ]\"\n\ncorrect <- c( \"A____\",  \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",        \n              \"A____\",        \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\" ) \n\nresponse <- c(\"A____\",  \n              \"AB___\",      \n              \"A___E\",      \n              \"AB__E\",        \n              \"____E\",\n              \"___DE\",\n              \"_BCDE\",      \n              \"ABCDE\",      \n              \"_____\" )\n\ni <- c(        5,       \n               4,              \n               4,              \n               3,               \n               \n               3,\n               2,\n               0,\n               1,\n               4)\n\nabs <- c(f_dichom(5,5), \n         f_dichom(4,5), \n         f_dichom(4,5), \n         f_dichom(3,5), \n         \n         f_dichom(3,5), \n         f_dichom(2,5),\n         f_dichom(0,5),\n         f_dichom(1,5),\n         f_dichom(4,5))\n\npartial1 <- c(f_partialN(5,5), \n              f_partialN(4,5), \n              f_partialN(4,5), \n              f_partialN(3,5), \n              \n              f_partialN(3,5), \n              f_partialN(2,5),\n              f_partialN(0,5),\n              f_partialN(1,5),\n              f_partialN(4,5))\n\npartial2 <- c(f_partialP(1,1,0,4), \n              f_partialP(1,1,1,4), \n              f_partialP(1,1,1,4), \n              f_partialP(1,1,2,4), \n              \n              f_partialP(0,1,1,4),\n              f_partialP(0,1,2,4),\n              f_partialP(0,1,4,4),\n              f_partialP(1,1,4,4), \n              f_partialP(0,1,0,4))\n\nnames = c(    \"Correct Answer\",\n              \"Response\",\n              \"i \",\n              \"Dichotomous\",\n              \"Partial [-1/n, +1/n]\",\n              \"Partial[-1/q, +1/p]\")\n\ndt <- data.frame(correct, response, i, abs, partial1 , partial2)\n\nkbl(dt, col.names = names, caption = title, digits=3) %>%\n  kable_classic() %>%\n    add_header_above(c(\"Response Scenario \" = 3, \"Scores\" = 3)) %>% \n    pack_rows(\"Perfect Response\", 1, 1) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Correct + Extra Incorrect Selections\", 2, 4) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Only Incorrect Selections\", 5, 6) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Completely Inverse Response \", 7, 7) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Selected ALL or NONE\", 8, 9) %>%\n    footnote(general = paste(\"i = number of options in correct state;

This scheme does now allow us to differentiate between different response patters.\nThe Partial \\([-1/n, +1/n]\\) scheme yields a range from \\([-1,1]\\), differentiating between responses. However, a blank response (bottom row) receives the same score (0.6) as the selection of the correct option + 1 incorrect option (row 2), which is problematic with for the goals of this study, where we need to differentiate between states of confusion or uncertainty yielding blank responses and the intentional selection of incorrect items.\nThe Partial \\([-1/q, +1/p]\\) scheme also yields a range of scores from \\([-1,1]\\). A blank response (bottom row) yields the same score (\\(0\\)) as the selection of all answer options (row 7); both are patterns of behavior we would expect to see if a respondent is confused or uncertain that there is a correct answer to the question.\n\nNext we consider an example from our study, with \\(n = 15\\) options and \\(p = 1\\) correct option to be selected.\n\nCODEtitle <- \"Comparison of Scoring Schemes for SGC3 with n=15 and p=1 options [A,B...N,O]  \"\n\ncorrect <- c( \"A____\",  \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",        \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\",      \n              \"A____\" ) \n\nresponse <- c(\"A__...__\",  \n              \"AB_...__\",      \n              \"A__..._O\",      \n              \"AB_..._O\",        \n              \"___..._O\",      \n              \"___...NO\",      \n              \"_BC...NO\",\n              \"ABC...NO\",      \n              \"___...__\" )\n\ni <- c(        15,       \n               14,              \n               14,              \n               13,\n               13,               \n               12,          \n               0,\n               1,\n               14)\n\nabs <- c(f_dichom(15,15), \n         f_dichom(14,15), \n         f_dichom(14,15), \n         f_dichom(13,15), \n         f_dichom(13,15),\n         f_dichom(12,15),\n         f_dichom(0,15),\n         f_dichom(1,15),\n         f_dichom(14,15))\n\npartial1 <- c(f_partialN(15,15), \n              f_partialN(14,15), \n              f_partialN(14,15), \n              f_partialN(13,15), \n              f_partialN(13,15),\n              f_partialN(12,15),\n              f_partialN(0,15),\n              f_partialN(1,15),\n              f_partialN(14,15))\n\npartial2 <- c(f_partialP(1,1,0,14), \n              f_partialP(1,1,1,14), \n              f_partialP(1,1,1,14), \n              f_partialP(1,1,2,14), \n              f_partialP(0,1,1,14),\n              f_partialP(0,1,2,14),\n              f_partialP(0,1,14,14),\n              f_partialP(1,1,14,14), \n              f_partialP(0,1,0,14))\n\nnames = c(    \"Correct Answer\",\n              \"Response\",\n              \"$i$ \",\n              \"Dichotomous\",\n              \"Partial [-1/n, +1/n]\",\n              \"Partial [-1/q, +1/p]\")\n\ndt <- data.frame(correct, response, i, abs, partial1 , partial2)\n\nkbl(dt, col.names = names, caption = title, digits=3) %>%\n  kable_classic() %>%\n    add_header_above(c(\"Response Scenario \" = 3, \"Scores\" = 3)) %>% \n    pack_rows(\"Perfect Response\", 1, 1) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Correct + Extra Incorrect Selections\", 2, 4) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Only Incorrect Selections\", 5, 6) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Completely Inverse Response \", 7, 7) %>%\n    pack_rows(\"Selected ALL or NONE\", 8, 9) %>%\n    footnote(general = paste(\"i = number of options in correct state;

Specifically, there are certain patterns of options that correspond to a triangular versus orthogonal interpretations. In the previous example, rows 2 and 3 both indicate a subject has selected the correct option (A) plus one additional option (B or O). Both responses receive the same score under \\([-1/q, +1/q]\\). These two responses may be very meaningfully different, however if one of the alternate options chosen indicates a different interpretation of the stimulus. The inclusion of data-point B might be reasonable under some degree of visual tracing error, while the inclusion of data-point O might indicate a cartesian misinterpretation of the coordinate system. Essentially, some answer options are more incorrect than others. We want to be able to differentiate between these responses.\nTo accomplish this task, we need to sets of interpretation-consistent options for each item. Based on our prior work, we define four interpretations for which to define options. We can think of these as four different answer keys, each defining the set of ‘correct’ options (those that should be selected) under each interpretation of the graph.\n\nTriangular : the (true, actually correct) triangular interpretation of the coordinate system; indicated by data points intersecting the appropriate diagonal projection from the x-axis.\nOrthogonal: the (incorrect but most common) cartesian interpretation of the coordinate system; indicated by data points intersecting an (invisible) orthogonal projection from the x-axis.\nLines-Connect: an (incorrect) interpretation that is partially-triangular, insofar as it is indicated by data points intersecting any diagonal projection from the x-axis (not necessarily the correct projection).\nSatisficing: an (incorrect) interpretation that indicated by selecting the data points nearest to the (invisible) orthogonal projection from the x-axis; indicates an orthogonal interpretation in absence of an available orthogonal intersect.\n\nTODO FIX THIS SECTION ONWARDS … RESPONSE SETS NEED NOT BE MUTUTALLY EXCLUSIVE\nThus for each item, in the graph comprehension task, we will define five sets, whose members constitute a partition of the set of answer options.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nQ &= \\text{the (universal) set of all answer options } \\\\\n\\\\\nT &=  \\{o:o \\:is\\:triangular  \\}, |T| \\ne 0  \\\\\nR &=  \\{o:o \\:is\\:orthogonal \\} \\\\\nL &=  \\{o:o \\:is\\:line-connecting \\} \\\\\nS &=  \\{o:o \\:is\\:satisficing \\} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\emptyset &= T \\cap R \\cap L \\cap S  \\: \\text{(the interpretation sets are disjoint)}\\\\\nD &= Q - \\{T \\cup R \\cup L \\cup S \\} , \\text{(distractors; the remaining options not consistent with any interpretation})\n\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nFor example, for the following sample stimuli, TODO IMAGE\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nQ &= \\{a, b, c, d, e, f, g \\} \\\\\n  &= \\{ \\{a \\}\\}, \\{b\\}, \\{c,d\\}, \\{e\\},  \\{f,g\\}\\} \\\\\n\\\\\nT &= \\{ a \\} \\\\\nR &= \\{ b \\} \\\\\nL &= \\{ c,d \\} \\\\\nS &= \\{ e \\} \\\\\nD &= \\{ f, g\\} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo capture this important source of variation, we can apply the idea behind the partial scoring \\([-1/q, +1/p]\\) scheme in combination with the response option subgroups given by the graph interpretations to produce a single score (scaled from \\(-1\\) to \\(+1\\)) that captures the nature of the respondent’s partial knowledge.\nA Discriminant Score will offer:\n\n+1 for a complete triangular response\n-1 for a complete orthogonal response\n+/- fraction of complete triangular or orthogonal response\n0 for non-strategy responses\n0 for blank (empty) responses\n\n\\[\n  \\begin{align}\n\\text{Score}_{discriminant} &= 0 + 1*(t_s / t) - 1 * (r_s / r) + 0*(d_s / d) \\\\\n&= (t_s / t) - (r_s / r)\n\\tag{4}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\n\\(t = |T| =\\) number of triangular-correct options (consistent with triangular interpretation), \\(t \\gt 0\\)\n\n\n\\(r = |R| =\\) number of orthogonal-correct options (consistent with orthogonal interpretation), \\(t \\gt 0\\)\n\n\n\\(d\\) = number of non-strategy options (not consistent with either interpretation), \\(t \\gt 0\\)\n\n\n\\(n\\) = total number of response options (equals the number of checkboxes in the question; equals the number of data points in the stimulus graph)\n\n\\(n = t + r + d\\) (15 for scaffold phase, 18 for test phase)\n\n\\(t_s\\) = number of triangular-correct options selected, \\(t_s \\ge 0\\)\n\n\n\\(r_s\\) = number of orthogonal-correct options selected, \\(r_s \\ge 0\\)\n\n\n\\(d_s\\) = number of non-strategy options options selected, \\(d_s \\ge 0\\)\n\n\n\\(s\\) = number of options selected, \\(s \\ge 0\\)\n\n\\(s = t_s + r_s + d_s\\)\n\nTODO:: add 0.5(tversky) - 0.5(satisficing)\n\nCODEf_discrim <- function(t_s,t,r_s,r){\n  return((t_s / t) - (r_s / r))\n}"

The graph comprehensiontask asks them to select the data points in the graph that meet the criteria posed in the question. To assess a participant’s performance, for each question (q=15) we will calculate the following scores:\nAn overall, strict score:\n1. Absolute Score : using dichotomous scoring referencing true (Triangular) answer. (see 1.2)\nSub-scores, for each alternative graph interpretation\n2. Triangular Score : using partial scoring [-1/q, +1/p] referencing true (Triangular) answer key.\n3. Orthogonal Score : using partial scoring [-1/q, +1/p] referencing (incorrect Orthogonal) answer key.\n4. Tversky Score : using partial scoring [-1/q, +1/p] referencing (incorrect connecting-lines strategy) answer key.\n5. Satisficing Score : using partial scoring [-1/q, +1/p] referencing (incorrect satisficing stategy) answer key.\n\n2.3.1 Prepare Answer Keys\nWe start by importing the answer keys for each stimulus set.

In order to calculate subscores for each graph interpretation (triangular, orthogonal) we must define these sets independently for each interpretation. The answer key files the ‘correct’ answer (i.e. set P) for each interpretation, for each question. We must derive the contents of set Q based on set\n\nSET N = all response options (superset) \\(N\\)\nSET P = all options that should be selected (rewarded as +1/p) \\(P \\subset N\\)\nSET A = items that should not be selected, but if they are, don’t penalize (ignored). These include any options referenced in the question (i.e. select shifts that start at the same time as X; don’t penalize if they also select ‘X’), as well as options within 0.5hr offset from the data point to accommodate reasonable visual errors.\\(A \\subset N\\)\nSET Q = all options that should NOT be selected (penalized as -1/q).
