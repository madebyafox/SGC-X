\newpage

In Study 3A we explore a hypothesis that emerged from analysis of Study
2, that \emph{presenting a learner with a situation that induces a state
of impasse will increase the probability that learners experience a
moment of insight, and in turn restructure their interpretation of the
coordinate system.}

In the context of Study 2, an impasse state was (unintentionally)
induced when the combination of question + data set yielded no available
answer in the incorrect (cartesian) interpretation of the graph. In
Study 3A, we test this hypothesis by comparing performance between a
(treatment) group receiving impasse-inducing questions followed by
normal questions, and a non-impasse control.

\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}}

\textbf{Experimental Hypothesis:} \emph{Learners posed with
impasse-inducing questions will be more likely to correct interpret the
graph.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  H1A \textbar{} Learners in the impasse condition will have better
  cumulative accuracy (get more questions correctly overall)
\item
  H1B \textbar{} Learners in the impasse condition will be more likely
  to correctly answer the first question
\item
  H1C \textbar{} Learners in the impasse condition will spend more time
  on the first question.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Null Hypothesis:} \emph{No significant differences in
performance will exist between learners in the impasse and control
conditions.}

\textbf{Exploratory Questions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consistency \textbar{} How consistent are learners in their
  interpretation of the graph? Do they adopt an interpretation on the
  first question and hold constant? Or do they change interpretations
  from question to question? Are there any interpretations that serve as
  `absorbing states' (i.e.~once encountered, the learner does not exist
  this state).
\item
  Time Course of Exploration \textbar{} What is the relationship between
  response accuracy (and interpretation) and time spent on each item?
\item
  Can exploration strategies be derived from mouse cursor activity?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\section{METHODS}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{design}{%
\subsection{Design}\label{design}}

We employed a mixed design with 1 between-subjects factor with 2 levels
(Scaffold: control, impasse) and 15 items (within-subjects factor).

Independent Variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  B-S (Scaffold: control,impasse)
\item
  W-S (Item x 15)
\end{itemize}

Dependent Variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Response Accuracy : Is the response triangular-correct?
\item
  Response Interpretation : (derived) With which interpretation of the
  graph is the subject's response on an individual question consistent?
\item
  Response Latency : Time from stimulus onset to clicking `Submit'
  button: time in (s)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{materials}{%
\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}}

Stimuli consisted of a series of 15 graph comprehension questions, each
testing a different combination of time interval relations, to be read
from a Triangular-Model graph. Figure~\ref{fig-sample}. The list of
questions can be found \href{static/stimuli/sgcx_questions.csv}{here}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{analysis/SGC3A/static/stimuli/sample_task.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-sample}Sample Question (Q=1) for Graph Comprehension
Task}

\end{figure}

Note that across both control and impasse conditions, both the question,
response options and graph structure were identical. The experimental
manipulation (posing a mental impasse) was accomplished by changing the
position of datapoints in the impasse-condition graph, such that for any
given question, there was no available response option if the reader
were to interpret the graph as cartesian (making an orthogonal rather
than diagonal projection from the x-axis.)

\emph{The green line indicates the ideal-scanpath to the correct
(triangular) answer to the first question, and the red line indicates
the (incorrect) orthogonal interpretation. In the IMPASSE figure (at
right), there are no data points that intersect the red line. We
hypothesize that this presents the reader with an obstacle, at which
point they are forced to confront their interpretation of the coordinate
system and (ideally) develop a new strategy.}

\hypertarget{procedure}{%
\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}}

Participants completed the study via a web-browser.

(1) Upon starting, they submitted informed consent, before reading task
instructions.

(2) Participants were introduced to a scenario in which they were to
play the role of a project manager, scheduling shifts for a group of
employees. The schedule of the employees was presented in a
TriangularModel (TM) graph, and they would be answering question about
the schedule.

(3) Then participants completed an experimental block of 15 items.

(3A) The first five items in the task are defined as the SCAFFOLDING
block. In the IMPASSE condition, the first five questions included an
IMPASSE problem state. For participants in the CONTROL condition, the
dataset was structure such that there was always an available
`orthogonal answer' for the first 5 questions.

(3B) The remaining 10 items are defined as the TESTING block. In both
conditions, these questions were not structured as impasse
(i.e.~contained an available orthogonal answer)

(4) Following the experimental block, participants answered a
free-response question about their strategy for reading the graph,
followed by a demographic questionnaire and debrief.

\hypertarget{sample}{%
\subsection{Sample}\label{sample}}

Data was collected by convenience sample of a university subject pool.
Initial data (Fall 2017, Spring 2018) were collected in-person, with
large groups of students simultaneously completing the study
(independently) in a computer lab. In Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 we
collected additional data to replicate results in a remote format
(students completing the study asynchronously on their own computers).

\hypertarget{analysis}{%
\section{ANALYSIS}\label{analysis}}

\hypertarget{data-preparation}{%
\subsection{Data Preparation}\label{data-preparation}}

Data were collected via a custom web application and stored in a NoSQL
database. The following exclusion criteria were applied during data
cleaning:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  completion status : ``success'' ; subject must have finished all parts
  of the study, including demographic questionnaire
\item
  session ID: {[}in list{]} ; subject must have been assigned to valid
  data collection session (discard testing and piloting data)
\item
  browser interaction violations \textless{} 3; subject must have fewer
  than 3 violations of non-allowed browser interactions (i.e.~resizing
  window, leaving browser tab or leaving fullscreen mode)
\item
  self-rated effort \textgreater{} 2; subjects who reported, ``not
  trying hard/rushing through questions'' or ``started out trying hard
  but giving up at some point'' were excluded from analysis.
\item
  attention check ==TRUE ; subjects who failed to answer a mid-study
  attention check question (Graph Comprehension Task Question \#6) are
  excluded
\end{itemize}

Before analysis, data files from individual data collection periods are
harmonized into a common data format
(Section~\ref{sec-SGC3A-harmonize}).

The underlying data structure of the stimulus web application changed
across the data collection period, resulting in slightly different data
files (i.e.~columns are not named consistently). In this section, we
combine the files from each data collection period into a single
\emph{harmonized} data file for analysis (one for participants, one for
items).

\hypertarget{participants}{%
\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}}

First we import participant-level data from each data collection period,
selecting only the columns relevant for analysis, and renaming columns
to be consistent across each file. The result is a single data frame
\texttt{df\_subjects} containing one row for each subject (across all
periods). Note that we \emph{are not} discarding any \emph{response}
data. Rather, we discard columns that are automatically recorded by the
stimulus web application and help the application run.

\emph{Note that we discard some columns representing scores calculated
in the stimulus engine. These scores were calculated differently across
collection periods, and so we discard them and recalculate scores in the
next analysis notebook. No raw data (responses and response times) are
discarded, only algorithmically-derived scores for the responses.}

\hypertarget{items}{%
\subsubsection{Items}\label{items}}

Next we import item-level data from each data collection period,
selecting only the columns relevant for analysis, and renaming columns
to be consistent across each file. The result is a single data frame
\texttt{df\_items} containing one row for each \emph{graph comprehension
task question} (qs=15) (across all periods). A second data frame
\texttt{df\_freeresponse} contains one row for each free response
strategy question (last question posed to participants in Winter2022)
Note that we \emph{do not} discard any \emph{response} data. Rather, we
\emph{do} discard several columns representing accuracy scores for
responses that were calculated in the stimulus engine. These scores were
calculated differently across collection periods, and so we discard them
and recalculate scores in the next analysis notebook. Original response
data are always preserved.

be assigned a score. Approaches to scoring MR data and score

\emph{The purpose of this notebook is to score (assign a measure of
accuracy) to response data for the SGC\_3A study. This is required
because the question type on the graph comprehension task used a
`Multiple Response' (MR) question design. Here, we evaluate different
approaches to scoring multiple response questions, and transform raw
item responses (e.g.~boxes ABC are checked) to a measure of response
accuracy. (Warning: this notebook takes several minutes to execute.)}

\section{MULTIPLE RESPONSE SCORING}\label{multiple-response-scoring}}

The \emph{graph comprehension task} of study SGC 3A presents readers
with a graph, a question, and a series of checkboxes. Participants are
instructed to use the graph to answer the question, and respond by
selecting all the checkboxes that apply, where each checkbox corresponds
to a datapoint in the graph.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

In the psychology and education literatures on Tests \& Measures, the
format of this type of question is referred to as Multiple Response
(MR), (also: Multiple Choice Multiple Answer (MCMA) and Multiple Answer
Multiple Choice (MAMC)). It has a number of properties that make it
different from traditional Single Answer Multiple Choice (SAMC)
questions, where the respondent marks a single response from a number of
options. In particular, there are a number of very different ways that
MAMC questions can be \emph{scored}.

In tranditional SAMC format questions, one point is given for selecting
the option designated as correct, and zero points given for marking any
of the alternative (i.e.~distractor) options. Individual response
options on MAMC questions, however might be partially correct (\(i\)),
while responses on other answer options within the same item might be
incorrect (\(n – i\)). In MR, it is not obvious how to allocate points
when the respondent marks a true-correct option (i.e.~options that
\emph{should} be selected, denoted \(p\)), as well as one or more
false-correct options (i.e.~options that \emph{should not} be selected,
denoted \(q\)). Should partial credit be awarded? If so, are options
that respondents false-selected and false-unselected items equally
penalized?

Schmidt et al. (2021) performed a systematic literature review of
publications proposing MAMC (or equivalent) scoring schemes, ultimately
synthesizing over 80 sources into 27 distinct scoring approaches. Upon
reviewing the benefits of trade-offs of each approach, for this study we
choose utilize two of the schemes: \textbf{dichotomous scoring} (
Schmidt et al. (2021) scheme \#1), and \textbf{partial scoring}
\([-1/q,0, +1/p]\) ( Schmidt et al. (2021) scheme \#26), as well as a
scaled \textbf{discriminant score} that leverages partial scoring to
discriminate between strategy-specific patterns of response.

\hypertarget{response-encoding}{%
\subsection{Response Encoding}\label{response-encoding}}

First, we note that the question type evaluated by Schmidt et al. (2021)
is referred to as \emph{Multiple True-False} (MTF), a variant of MAMC
where respondents are presented with a question (stem) and series of
response options with True/False (e.g.~radio buttons) for each.
Depending on the implementation of the underlying instrument, it may or
may not be possible for respondents to \emph{not respond} to a
particular option (i.e.~leave the item `blank'). Although MTF questions
have a different underlying implementation (and potentially different
psychometric properties) they are identical in their mathematical
properties; that is, responses to a MAMC question of `select all that
apply' can be coded as a series of T/F responses to each response option

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{analysis/SGC3A/static/img/MAMC-MTF.png}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ItemTypes}\textbf{Figure 2. SAMC (vs) MAMC (vs)
MTF}}

\end{figure}

In this example (Figure~\ref{fig-ItemTypes}), we see an example of a
question with four response options (\(n=4\)) in each question type. In
the \textbf{SAMC} approach (at left), there are four possible responses,
given explicitly by the response options (respondent can select only
one) \((\text{number of possible responses} = n)\). With only four
possible responses, we cannot entirely discriminate between all
combinations of the underlying response variants we might be interested
in, and must always choose an `ideal subset' of possible distractors to
present as response options. In the MAMC (middle) and MTF (at right),
the \emph{same number of response options} (\(n=4\)) yield a much
greater number \((\text{number of possible responses} = 2^{n})\). We can
also see the equivalence between a MAMC and MTF format questions with
the same response options. Options the respondent \emph{selects} in MAMC
are can be coded as T, and options they leave \emph{unselected} can be
coded as F. Thus, for response options (ABCD), a response of {[}AB{]}
can also be encoded as {[}TTFF{]}.

\hypertarget{scoring-schemes}{%
\subsection{Scoring Schemes}\label{scoring-schemes}}

In the sections that follow, we use the terminology:

\textbf{Properties of the Stimulus-Question}

\begin{align}
n &= \text{number of response options} \\  
  &= p + q \\ 
  p &= \text{number of true-select options (i.e. should be selected)} \\
  q &= \text{number of true-unselect options (i.e. should not be selected)} 
\end{align}

\textbf{Properties of the Subject's Response}

\begin{align} 
i &= \text{number of options in correct state}, (0 ≤ i ≤ n) \\ 
f &= \text{resulting score} 
\end{align}

\hypertarget{sec-absolute-scoring}{%
\subsubsection{Dichotomous Scoring}\label{sec-absolute-scoring}}

\textbf{Dichotomous Scoring} is the strictest scoring scheme, where a
response only receives points if it is \emph{exactly} correct, meaning
the respondent includes \emph{only correct-select} options, and does
select any additional (i.e.~incorrect-select) options that should not be
selected. This is also known as \emph{all or nothing scoring}, and
importantly, it ignores any partial knowledge that a participant may be
expressing through their choice of options. They may select some but not
all of the correct-select options, and one or more but not all of the
correct-unselect items, but receive the same score as a respondent
selects none of the correct-select options, or all of the
correct-unselect options. In this sense, dichotomous scoring tells us
\emph{only} about perfect knowledge, and ignores any indication of
partial knowledge the respondent may be indicating through their
selection of response options.

\textbf{In Dichotomous Scoring}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  score for the question is either 0 or 1
\item
  full credit is only given if all responses are correct; otherwise no
  credit
\item
  does not account for \emph{partial knowledge}. - with increasing
  number of response options, scoring becomes stricter as each statement
  must be marked correctly.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm for \textbf{dichotomous scoring} is given by:

\begin{gather*}
f = 
\begin{cases}
  1, \text{if } i = n \\    
  0, \text{otherwise}    
\end{cases}
\end{gather*} \text{where } 0 \le i \le n

\hypertarget{partial-scoring--1n-1n}{%
\subsubsection{Partial Scoring {[}-1/n,
+1/n{]}}\label{partial-scoring--1n-1n}}

\textbf{Partial Scoring} refers to a class or scoring schemes that award
the respondent partial credit depending on pattern of options they
select. Schmidt et al. (2021) identify twenty-six different partial
credit scoring schemes in the literature, varying in the range of
possible scores, and the relative weighting of incorrectly selected (vs)
incorrectly unselected options.

A particularly elegant approach to partial scoring is referred to as the
\([-1/n, +1/n]\) approach ( Schmidt et al. (2021) \#17). This approach
is appealing in the context of SGC3A, because it: (1) takes into account
all information provided by the respondent: the pattern of what the
select, and choose not to select.

\textbf{In Partial Scoring} \([-1/n, +1/n]\):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Scores range from {[}-1, +1{]}
\item
  One point is awarded if all options are \emph{correct}
\item
  One point point is subtracted if all options are \emph{incorrect}.
\item
  Intermediate results are credited as fractions accordingly (\(+1/n\)
  for each correct, \(-1/n\) for each incorrect)
\item
  This results in \emph{at chance performance} (i.e.~half of the given
  options marked correctly), being awarded 0 points are awarded
\end{itemize}

This scoring is more consistent with the motivating theory that
Triangular Graph readers start out with an incorrect (i.e.~orthogonal,
cartesian) interpretation of the coordinate system, and transition to a
correct (i.e.~triangular) interpretation. But the first step in making
this transition is realizing the cartesian interpretation \emph{is
incorrect}, which may yield blank responses where the respondent is
essentially saying, `there is no correct answer to this question'.

Schmidt et al. (2021) describe the \emph{Partial} \({[-1/n, +1/n]}\)
scoring scheme as the \emph{only} scoring method (of the 27 described)
where respondents' scoring results can be interpreted as a percentage of
their true knowledge. One important drawback of this method is that a
respondent may receive credit (a great deal of credit, depending on the
number of answer options n) even if she did not select \emph{any}
options. In the case (such as ours) where there are many more response
options \(n\) than there are options meant to be selected \(p\), this
partial scoring algorithm poses a challenge because the respondent can
achieve an almost completely perfect score by selecting a small number
of options that should not be selected.

The algorithm for \textbf{partial scoring}\([-1/n, +1/n]\) is given by:

\begin{align}
f &= (1/n * i) - (1/n * (n-i)) \\
&= (2i - n)/{n} 
\end{align}

\hypertarget{partial-scoring--1q-1p}{%
\subsubsection{Partial Scoring {[}-1/q,
+1/p{]}}\label{partial-scoring--1q-1p}}

One drawback of the Partial Scoring \([-1/n, +1/n]\) approach is that
treats the choice to select, and choice to not select options as equally
indicative of the respondent's understanding. That is to say,
incorrectly selecting one particular option is no more or less
informative than incorrectly not-selecting a different item. This
represents an important difference between MAMC (i.e.~``select all
correct options'') vs MTF (i.e.~``Mark each option as true or false'')
questions.

In our study, the selection of any particular option (remember options
represent data points on the stimulus graph) is indicative of a
particular interpretation of the stimulus. Incorrectly selecting an
option indicates an interpretation of the graph with respect to that
particular option. Alternatively, failing to select a correct option
\emph{might} mean the individual has a different interpretation, or that
they failed to find \emph{all} the data points consistent with the
interpretation.

For this reason, we consider another alternative Partial Scoring scheme
that takes into consideration only the selected statements, without
penalizing statements incorrectly \emph{not selected}. (See Schmidt et
al. (2021) method \#26; also referred to as the Morgan-Method) This
partial scoring scheme takes into consideration that the most
effort-free (or `default') response for any given item is the null, or
blank response. Blank responses indicate \emph{no understanding},
perhaps \emph{confusion}, or refusal to answer. These lack of responses
are awarded zero credit. Whereas taking the action to select an
\emph{incorrect} option is effortful, and is indicative of
\emph{incorrect understanding}.

\textbf{Partial Scoring} \([-1/q, +1/p]\):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  awards +1/p for each correctly selected option (\(p_s\)), and
  subtracts \(1/(n-p) = 1/q\) for each incorrectly selected option
  (\(q_s\))
\item
  only considers \emph{selected} options; does not penalize nor reward
  \emph{unselected} options
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Properties of Item}

\begin{align}
p &= \text{number of true-select options (i.e. should be selected)} \\
q &= \text{number of true-unselect options (i.e. should not be selected)} \\
n &= \text{number of options} \: ( n = p + q)
\end{align}

\textbf{Properties of Response}

\begin{align}
p_s &= \text{number of true-select options selected (i.e. number of correctly checked options)}\\
q_s &= \text{number of true-unselect options selected (i.e. number of incorrectly checked options }
\end{align}

The algorithm for \textbf{partial scoring} \([-1/q, +1/p]\) is given by:

\begin{align}
f &= (p_s / p) - ({q_s}/{q}) \\

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We see that in the Dichotomous scheme, only the precisely correct
  response (row 1) yields a score other than zero. This scheme does now
  allow us to differentiate between different response patters.
\item
  The Partial \([-1/n, +1/n]\) scheme yields a range from \([-1,1]\),
  differentiating between responses. However, a blank response (bottom
  row) receives the same score (0.6) as the selection of the correct
  option + 1 incorrect option (row 2), which is problematic with for the
  goals of this study, where we need to differentiate between states of
  confusion or uncertainty yielding blank responses and the intentional
  selection of incorrect items.
\item
  The Partial \([-1/q, +1/p]\) scheme also yields a range of scores from
  \([-1,1]\). A blank response (bottom row) yields the same score
  (\(0\)) as the selection of \emph{all} answer options (row 7); both
  are patterns of behavior we would expect to see if a respondent is
  confused or uncertain that there is a correct answer to the question.
\end{itemize}

Next we consider an example from our study, with \(n = 15\) options and
\(p = 1\) correct option to be selected.

Here again we see that the Partial \([-1/q, +1/p]\) scheme allows us
differentiate between patterns of responses, in a way that is more
sensible for the goals of the SGC3 graph comprehension task.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, opacityback=0, toprule=.15mm, colframe=quarto-callout-color-frame, breakable, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, arc=.35mm, colback=white, left=2mm]
The Partial \([-1/q, +1/p]\) scheme is more appropriate for scoring the
graph comprehension task than the Partial \([-1/n, +1/n]\) scheme
because it allows us to differentially penalize incorrectly
\emph{selected} and incorrectly \emph{not selected} answer options.

\section{SCORE SGC DATA}\label{score-sgc-data}}

In SGC\_3A we are fundamentally interested in understanding how a
participant interprets the presented graph (stimulus). The \textbf{graph
comprehension task} asks them to select the data points in the graph
that meet the criteria posed in the question. To assess a participant's
performance, for each question (q=15) we will calculate the following
scores:

\emph{An overall, strict score:}\\
1. \textbf{Absolute Score} : using dichotomous scoring referencing true
(Triangular) answer. (see 1.2)

\emph{Sub-scores, for each alternative graph interpretation}\\
2. \textbf{Triangular Score} : using partial scoring {[}-1/q, +1/p{]}
referencing true (Triangular) answer key.

3. \textbf{Orthogonal Score} : using partial scoring {[}-1/q, +1/p{]}
referencing (incorrect Orthogonal) answer key.

Based on prior observational studies where we observed emergence of
other alternative interpretations (i.e.~transitional interpretations) we
also calculate subscores for these alternatives.

4. \textbf{Tversky Score} : using partial scoring {[}-1/q, +1/p{]}
referencing (incorrect connecting-lines strategy) answer key. 5.
\textbf{Satisficing Score} : using partial scoring {[}-1/q, +1/p{]}
referencing (incorrect satisficing strategy) answer key.

\hypertarget{prepare-answer-keys}{%
\subsection{Prepare Answer Keys}\label{prepare-answer-keys}}

We start by importing three answer keys: (1) Q1 - Q5 {[}control
condition{]}, (2) Q1-Q5 {[}impasse condition{]}, (3) Q6-15. Separate
answer keys by condition are required for Q1-Q5 because the stimuli for
each condition visualize a different underlying dataset (i.e.~the graphs
show datapoints in different positions). Q6-Q15 are identical across
conditions. Each answer key includes a row for each question, and a
column defining the subset of response options that correspond to
different graph interpretations.

In order to calculate scores using the \([-1/q, +1/p]\) algorithm, we
need to define the subset of all response options (set N) that should be
selected (set P) and should not be selected (set Q). In order to
calculate subscores for each graph interpretation (i.e.~triangular,
orthogonal, tversky) we must define these sets independently for each
interpretation. For each question, the \texttt{keys\_raw} dataframe
gives us set N (all response options), and a set P (options that should
be selected) for \emph{each interpretation}. From these we must derive
set Q for each interpretation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SET \(N\), all response options (superset) . This set is the same
  across all interpretations (a property of the question) and is given
  in the answer key.
\item
  SET \(P\), \(P \subset N\) , the subset of options that
  \textbf{should} be selected (rewarded as +1/p) . This set differs by
  interpretation, and is given in the answer key.
\item
  SET \(A, A \subset N, A \sqcup P\) , the subset of options that
  \textbf{should not} be selected, \emph{but if they are, aren't
  penalized} (i.e.~these options are ignored. Not rewarded, nor
  penalized). These include any options referenced in the question
  (i.e.~select shifts that start at the same time as X; don't penalize
  if they also select `X'), as well as options within 0.5hr offset from
  the data point to accommodate reasonable visual errors. This set
  differs by interpretation, and is given in the answer key (columns
  \texttt{REF\_POINT} and \texttt{\_also}).
\item
  SET \(Q\), the subset of options that \textbf{should not be selected}
  and are penalized (as -1/q). This set differs by interpretation and is
  not given in the answer key. We can derive set Q for each
  interpretation by \(Q = N - (P \cup A)\)
\end{itemize}

The next step in scoring is preparing interpretation-specific answer
keys that specify sets N, P, A and Q for each question.

This leaves us a dataframe \texttt{keys\_tri} that define the sets of
response options consistent with the triangular graph interpretation.

To verify we have generated the correct sets, we verify that for each
question, each option in N is included in either set P, A or Q (once and
only once).

TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,

\hypertarget{tversky-keys}{%
\subsubsection{Tversky Keys}\label{tversky-keys}}

Next we construct the key set based on a partial-understanding strategy
we refer to as `Tversky'. We use the label Tversky as shorthand for a
partial interpretation of the coordinate system where subjects select a
set of responses that lay along a connecting line from the referenced
data point or referenced time for that item. The term is named for
Barbara Tversky based on her work on graphical primitives (e.g.~``lines
connect, arrows direct, boxes contain'').

This leaves us four dataframes, each corresponding to a different
variant of a `lines connecting to reference point' strategy.\\
- \texttt{keys\_tversky\_max} : the superset of lines connecting options
- \texttt{keys\_tversky\_start} : lines connecting to the rightward
diagonal (start time) of the reference point -
\texttt{keys\_tversky\_end}: lines connecting to the leftward diagonal
(end time) of the reference point - \texttt{keys\_tversky\_duration}:
lines connecting to the horizontal y-intercept (duration) of the
reference point

To verify we have generated the correct sets, we verify that for each
question, each response in N is included in either set P, A or Q (once
and only once).

TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,

\hypertarget{satisficing-key}{%
\subsubsection{Satisficing Key}\label{satisficing-key}}

Next we construct two keys based on the `Satisficing' strategy.
Satisficing involves selecting any data points within 0.5hr visual
offset of the orthogonal interpretation of the graph (because no
orthogonal response option is available). One key represents selecting a
point slightly to the left of the orthogonal, and the other key
represents selecting a point slightly to the right of the orthogonal.
The ``Satisficing'' strategy involves the reader selecting data points
\emph{nearest} to the orthogonal projection from the reference point in
the question. We observe this strategy in some readers when there is no
orthogonal response available (i.e.~in the impasse condition), so they
select the points nearest to the projection (i.e.~``close enough'').

This leaves us a dataframe \texttt{keys\_satisfice} that define the sets
of response options consistent with the orthogonal graph interpretation.

To verify we have generated the correct sets, we verify that for each
question, each response in N is included in either set P, A or Q (once
and only once).

TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE,

\hypertarget{score-items}{%
\subsection{Score Items}\label{score-items}}

Next, we import the item-level response data. For each row in the item
level dataset (indicating the response to a single question-item for a
single subject), we compare the raw response
\texttt{df\_items\$response} with the answer keys in each interpretation
(e.g.~\texttt{keys\_orth}, \texttt{keys\_tri}, etc\ldots), then using
those sets, determine the number of correctly selected items(p) and
incorrectly selected items (q), which in turn are used to calculate
partial{[}-1/q, +1/p{]} scores for each interpretation. The resulting
scores are then stored on each item in \texttt{df\_items}, and can be
used to determine which graph interpretation the subject held.

Specifically, the following scores are calculated for each item:

\textbf{Interpretation Subscores}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{score\_TRI} How consistent is the response with the
  \textbf{triangular}interpretation?
\item
  \texttt{score\_ORTH} How consistent is the response with the
  \textbf{orthogonal}interpretation?
\item
  \texttt{score\_SATISFICE} is calculated by taking the maximum value of
  :

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{score\_SAT\_left} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(left side) Satisficing} interpretation?
  \item
    \texttt{score\_SAT\_right} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(right side) Satisficing} interpretation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{score\_TVERSKY} is calculated by taking the maximum value of:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \texttt{score\_TV\_max} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(maximal) Tversky} interpretation?
  \item
    \texttt{score\_TV\_start} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(start-time) Tversky} interpretation?
  \item
    \texttt{score\_TV\_end} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(end-time) Tversky}i nterpretation?
  \item
    \texttt{score\_TV\_duration} How consistent is the response with the
    \textbf{(duration) Tversky} interpretation?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{score\_REF} Did the response select only the \textbf{reference
  point}?
\item
  \texttt{score\_BOTH} How consistent is the response with \textbf{both}
  the orthogonal and triangular interpretations?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Absolute Scores}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{score\_ABS} Is the response strictly correct? (triangular
  interpretation)
\item
  \texttt{score\_niceABS} Is the response strictly correct? (triangular
  interpretation, not penalizing ref points). This is a more generous
  version of the Absolute score that does not penalize the participant
  if in addition to the correct answer \emph{in addition to} they also
  select the data point referenced in the question.

\subsection{Derive Interpretation}\label{sec-SGC3A-interpretation}}

Finally, we use the interpretation subscores to classify the response as
a particular interpretation. This classification algorithm : (1) First
decides if the response matches one or more `special' situations (blank
response, reference point response, both ORTH and TRI) (2) If response
doesn't match a special situation, it compares the individual subscores,
and subscores and decides if they are \emph{discriminant} (i.e.~are the
scores different enough to make a prediction). A discriminant threshold
of 0.5pts (on a scale from -1 to +1 is used) (2) If the variance in
subscores surpasses the threshold, the interpretation is classified
based on the highest subscore (TRIANGULAR, ORTHOGONAL, TVERSKY,
SATISFICE) (3) If the variance does not surpass the threshold, the
interpretation is labelled as ``?'', indicating it cannot be classified,
and is of an unknown interpretation.

The final output is called \texttt{best}.

\subsection{Derive Scaled Score}\label{sec-SGC3A-scaledScore}}

The \texttt{interpretation} response variable gives us the finest grain
indication of the reader's understanding of the graph for a particular
question. However, it is a categorical variable, which poses a challenge
for analyzing cumulative performance at the subject level. To address
this challenge, we derive a \emph{scaled\_score} that converts each
possible interpretation to a numeric value on a scale from -1 to +1.
This scaling takes advantage of the observation that each interpretation
can be positioned along a spectrum of understanding from completely
incorrect (orthogonal) to completely correct (triangular). Alternative
interpretations lay somewhere between.

Specifically, we assign the following values to each interpretation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  (-1) : ORTHOGONAL, SATISFICE (satisfice represents an attempt at an
  orthogonal answer when none is available)
\item
  (-0.5): ? (some alternative that cannot be identified; but meaningful
  that it is not orthogonal)
\item
  (0): REFERENCE POINT, BLANK (indicates the individual thinks there is
  no answer, recognizes that ORTHOGONAL cannot be correct, but does not
  conceive of triangular)
\item
  (+0.5) TVERSKY, BOTH TRI + ORTH (indicates that they ``see'' a
  triangular response, but lack certainty and also select the ORTHOGONAL
  response)
\item
  (+1) TRIANGULAR +1
\end{itemize}

\section{EXPLORE RESPONSES}\label{explore-responses}}

In this section we explore responses given by participants to each
particular item in the graph comprehension task, indicate how each
response was scored, and what interpretation of the graph is indicated
by different responses.

\hypertarget{scaffold-phase}{%
\subsection{Scaffold Phase}\label{scaffold-phase}}

The first five questions constitute the `scaffold' (or learning) phase,
where participants see a different version of the stimulus (specifically
a different dataset is visualized) invoking a different experimental
condition.

\hypertarget{question-1}{%
\subsubsection{Question \#1}\label{question-1}}

\hypertarget{q1.-control-condition}{%

We start by exploring the range of response options checked by
participants on Question 1, for those assigned to the control
(non-impasse) condition (\texttt{condition} = 111).

Here we summarize the distinct response options given by participants on
this item. Each letter in \texttt{response} indicates a checkbox
selected by the participant (See Figure~\ref{fig-Q1-111} ). \texttt{n}
indicates the number of participants who gave this response, while
\texttt{interpretation} indicates the \emph{graph interpretation} most
consistent with that response. At the right of this table are the
Absolute, followed by Partial Credit subscores for each response. NA
indicates that there is no score calculated (occurs when there is no
subset of response options that accord with that interpretation for this
question).

Notice that for this Question, the \emph{Triangular} answer is the same
as the \emph{Tversky {[}start diagonal{]}} answer. In fact, for most
questions, one of the Tversky sub-types will match the correct response.

Notice that there \textbf{is no orthogonal answer} for this question.
This is the purpose of the impasse condition, to remove the possibility
of selecting the orthogonal answer, we expect learners will be more
likely to restructure their understanding of the coordinate system, and
arrive at a correct (triangular) interpretation.

Again, we see that most subjects selected a response consistent with one
of the identified interpretations. (note, when the question stem
includes a data point rather than time as reference, we do not penalize
respondents for selecting the reference data point \emph{in addition} to
an interpretation consistent response. For example, in this question, we
do not penalize respondents for selecting option D, the reference point
in the question. )

If the subject calculates end time for each data point (using duration
on the y axis), they find that an (incorrect) projection of point U `end
time' intersects with the (incorrect) orthogonal projection of 4:00PM. &
Alternatively, some subjects selected points E and D which intersect
with an orthogonal projection from 4:00pm. We call this an
'orthogonal-lines connect'' strategy, because it (incorrectly) adapts
the orthogonal procedure for finding events that \emph{start} at 4:00pm
in order to find those that \emph{end} at 4:00pm, thus selecting any
data point with an orthogonal intersection with 4:00pm. \\

modifications were made to the experimental platform to increase the
size of multiple-choice input buttons, and to add an additional
free-response question following the main task block. In Fall 2021, the
study was replicated using asynchronous, online SONA pool, with
additional participants collected in Winter 2022.

Recall from Section~\ref{sec-absolute-scoring} that the absolute score
(following the dichotomous scoring approach) \texttt{s\_NABS} indicates
if the subject's response for a particular item was \emph{perfectly}
correct: whether they selected all correct answer options and no others
(excluding certain allowed exceptions, such as also selecting the data
point referenced in the question). The absolute score for an individual
item is either 0 or 1. When summarized across the entire set of
discriminant items, the cumulative absolute score for an individual
subject ranges from {[}0,13{]}.

infact multimodal (m = 0.1, p \textless{} 0.001), with two identifiable
modes at 0.26 and 12.261, and an antimode at 6.985.

But what kind of distribution is this data? Next, we use the
\texttt{fitdistrplus} package to compare the distribution of this
variable to a variety of probability distribution families. First, we
transform the \# correct items to \% correct items by dividing it by the

Interpreting the Cullen and Frey graph, it \emph{appears} that number
percentage of correct responses per subject may follow a beta
distribution.

Infact, if we fit this variable using both a normal and beta
distribution (using method of moments), it appears that the beta
distribution provides a much better fit. The parameter estimates for the
beta distribution are: shape1 = 0.118, shape2 = 0.291.

\subsubsection{Total Scaled Scores}\label{total-scaled-scores}}

The total scaled score \texttt{s\_SCALED} summarizes the scaled score on
the 13 strategy-discriminant questions, for each subject. This score
ranges from from -13 (all orthogonal) to 13 (all triangular). Recall
that the \texttt{s\_SCALED} score for an item is a numeric
representation of the strategy-consistent response, scaled from -1 to +1
(see Section~\ref{sec-SGC3A-scaledScore})

Most importantly, the Scaled score gives us a way of quantitatively
examining how correctly a participant interpreted the coordinate system
across the entire set of items. It offers a more nuanced look into
performance than absolute score.

\textbf{Research Questions}

In SGC3A we set out to answer the following question: Does posing a
mental impasse improve performance on the graph comprehension task?

\emph{Specifically, we will test the following experimental hypotheses:}

\textbf{Experimental Hypothesis:} \emph{Learners posed with
impasse-inducing questions will be more likely to correct interpret the
graph.}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  H1A \textbar{} Learners in the impasse condition will have better
  cumulative accuracy (get more questions correctly overall)
\item
  H1B \textbar{} Learners in impasse condition will be more likely to
  correctly answer the first question
\item
  H1C \textbar{} Learners in the impasse condition will spend more time
  on the first question.
\end{itemize}

The Null Hypothesis asserts that \emph{no significant differences in
performance will exist between learners in the impasse and control
conditions.}

\textbf{Hypothesis} & (H1A) Participants in the IMPASSE condition will
have significantly higher cumulative performance than those in the
CONTROL condition. \\
\textbf{Analysis Strategy} & OLS Linear Regression \texttt{s\_NABS}
\textasciitilde{} \texttt{condition} \\
\textbf{Justification} & (0) goal is to understand how much variance in
absolute score is accounted for by condition

(1) linearity assumption \textbf{TODO}

(2) homoscedasticity assumption: \textbf{TODO}

(3) independence assumption : observations correspond to individual
participants and are thus independent

(2) normality assumption : \textbf{TODO} \\
\textbf{Steps} & (1) Calculate regression model using \texttt{lmer}

(2) Interpret coefficients

(3) Interpret ANOVA and \(R^2\) value

(4) Model diagnostics \\
\textbf{Inference} & \textbf{For in-lab data collection} an OLS linear
regression predicting cumulative absolute score by experimental
condition explains a statistically significant though small 7.5\%
variance in score (F(1,124) = 10.1, p \textless{} 0.01). The estimated
beta coefficient (\(\beta\) = 2.76, 95\% CI {[}1.04, 4.48{]}) predicts
that participants in the impasse condition will on average score 2.76
points (21\%) higher than those in the control condition.

\textbf{For the online replication}, an OLS linear regression model
predicting cumulative absolute score by condition explains a
statistically significant though small 5.5\% of variance in absolute
score (F(1,202) = 11.73, p \textless{} 0.001). The beta coefficient for
condition indicates that on average, participants in the IMPASSE group
scored 2.3 points higher on the task than those in the control condition
(\(\beta\) = 2.28, CI{[}0.97, 3.59{]}). \\

We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict s_ABS with condition (formula: s_ABS ~ condition). The model explains a statistically significant and weak proportion of variance (R2 = 0.08, F(1, 124) = 10.08, p = 0.002, adj. R2 = 0.07). The model's intercept, corresponding to condition = 111, is at 2.68 (95% CI [1.45, 3.90], t(124) = 4.32, p < .001). Within this model:

  - The effect of condition [121] is statistically significant and positive (beta = 2.76, 95% CI [1.04, 4.48], t(124) = 3.17, p = 0.002; Std. beta = 0.55, 95% CI [0.21, 0.89])

Standardized parameters were obtained by fitting the model on a standardized version of the dataset. 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values were computed using the Wald approximation.

represents the cumulative number of items a participant has answered
correctly, we can consider it a type of \emph{count}, (ie. count of the
number of questions the participant got correct) and attempt to model it

The graph comprehension tasks includes 15 questions completed in
sequence. But the first question the reader encounters (Q1) is the most
important, as it is their \emph{first exposure} to the unconventional
triangular coordinate system.

TODO: - does impasse yield different exploration behavior? (characterize
mouse) - does impasse yield more time on task? (characterize response
time ? number of answers then de-selected?)

TODO: Think about characterizing how variable the interpretations are
across a participant. Do they form an interpretation and hold it
constant? Or do they change question to question.

A proportional bar chart visualizing the proportion of incorrect (x =0)
vs correct (x = 1) responses in each condition (right/left facet) for
each data collection modality (top/bottom) reveal that the pattern of
responses appear the same regardless of the data collection modality. In
both data collection sessions, the proportion of incorrect responses is
much greater than the proportion of correct responses, regardless of
condition. In the impasse condition, the difference in proportions is
smaller than the control condition (i.e.~There are more correct
responses in the impasse condition than the control condition).

A mosaic plot condition by response accuracy on the first question
(across both data collection modalities) reveals the same pattern (the
mosaic plot is an alternative visualization technique to the
proportional bar chart). The relative size of condition boxes (111 vs
121) reflects that the sample is roughly evenly split across
experimental conditions. The difference in size between 0 (incorrect)
and 1 (correct) reflects that the proportion of correct responses (1) is
greater in the impasse condition (121).

Next, we compute a contingency table and Pearson's Chi-Squared test for
each data collection modality.

\textbf{For the in-lab data collection} (n=126) the Pearson's
Chi-squared test (of independence) indicates a relationship between
response accuracy on the first question and experimental condition
approaching statistical significance, \(\chi^2\) (1) = 10.3, p = 0.07.
Thus we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that
the odds ratio is equal to 1. In this particular data sample, the odds
ratio (Odds Ratio = 2.18, p = 0.055, 95\% CI {[}0.982, +Inf{]})
indicates that the odds of producing a correct response on the first
question were 2.18 times greater if a subject was in the impasse
condition, than in the control condition .

\textbf{For online data collection} (n=204), a Pearson's Chi-squared
test (of independence) indicates a statistically significant
relationship between response accuracy on the first question and
experimental condition, \(\chi^2\) (1) = 7.26, p = 0.009. Thus we have
sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is
equal to 1. The odds ratio (Odds Ratio = 2.68, p = 0.005, 95\% CI
{[}1.37, +Inf{]}) indicates that the odds of producing a correct
response on the first question were 2.68 times greater if a subject was
in the impasse condition, than in the control condition .

Exploratory Questions

Consistency \textbar{} How consistent are learners in their
interpretation of the graph? Do they adopt an interpretation on the
first question and hold constant? Or do they change interpretations from
question to question? Are there any interpretations that serve as
`absorbing states' (i.e.~once encountered, the learner does not exist
this state).

Time Course of Exploration \textbar{} What is the relationship between
response accuracy (and interpretation) and time spent on each item?

Can exploration strategies be derived from mouse cursor activity?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  does response time predict interpretation vs.~non interpretation?

\textbf{Analysis Strategy} & Chi-Square test of independence on outcome
\texttt{score\_niceABS} by \texttt{condition} for \texttt{df\_items}
where \texttt{q\ ==\ 1} \\
\textbf{Justification} & (0) simplest method to examine independence of
two categorical factors; logistic regression is recommended for binomial
\textasciitilde{} continuous

(1) independence assumption : as we only consider responses on the first
question, each observation corresponds to an individual subject, and are
thus independent

(2) frequency size assumption : expected frequency in each cell of the
contingency table is greater than 5 (more than 5 correct , more than 5
incorrect responses) \\
\textbf{Steps} & (1) Express raw data as contingency table \& visualize

(2) Calculate Chi-Squared Statistic and p-value

(3) Interpret Odds-Ratio as effect size \\
\textbf{Inference} & \textbf{Lab} A Pearson's Chi-squared test (of
independence) indicates a relationship between response accuracy on the
first question and experimental condition approaching statistical
significance, \(\chi^2\) (1) = 10.3, p = 0.07. Thus we have insufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to
1. In this particular data sample, the sample odds ratio 2.18 indicates
that the odds of producing a correct response on the first question were
2.18 times greater if a subject was in the impasse condition, than if
the control condition (Odds Ratio = 2.18, p = 0.055, 95\% CI {[}0.982,
+Inf{]}).

\textbf{Online} A Pearson's Chi-squared test (of independence) indicates
a statistically significant relationship between response accuracy on
the first question and experimental condition, \(\chi^2\) (1) = 7.26, p

that the odds ratio is equal to 1. The sample odds ratio = 2.68
indicates that the odds of producing a correct response on the first

Inspecting the output of the Chi-Squared test, we first see that we meet
the assumption of expected frequency in each cell (indicated by the
second row in each box, `Expected N'. The model predicts more than 5
observations in each cell.) The Pearson's Chi-squared test (of
independence) indicates a relationship between response accuracy on the
first question and experimental condition approaching statistical
significance, \(\chi^2\) (1) = 10.3, p = 0.07. Thus we have insufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is not equal
to 1. In this particular data sample, the odds ratio 2.18 indicates that
the odds of producing a correct response on the first question were 2.18
times greater if a subject was in the impasse condition, than in the
control condition (Odds Ratio = 2.18, p = 0.055, 95\% CI {[}0.982,

predicting scaled score by condition explains a statistically
significant and moderate 14\% of variance in absolute score (F(1,202) =
32.4, p \textless{} 0.001). The beta coefficient for condition indicates
that on average, participants in the IMPASSE group scored 6.8 points
higher on the task than those in the control condition (CI{[}4.43,

We fitted a linear model (estimated using OLS) to predict s_SCALED with condition (formula: s_SCALED ~ condition).
