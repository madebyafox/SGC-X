# Hypothesis Testing {#sec-SGC3A-hypotesting}

**TODO**

-   ORDINAL models on interpretation scale
-   HURDLE MODEL? (mixture model w/ 0 + count)
-   review models already created in ARCHIVE?

*The purpose of this notebook is test the hypotheses that determined the design of the SGC3A study.*

**Research Questions**

In SGC3A we set out to answer the following question: Does posing a mental impasse improve performance on the graph comprehension task?

**Experimental Hypothesis**\
*Learners posed with scenario designed to evoke a mental impasse will be more likely to correct interpret the graph.*

-   H1A \| Learners in the IMPASSE condition will be more likely to correctly answer the first question than learners in CONTROL.
-   H1B \| Learners in the IMPASSE condition will score higher on the TEST Phase than learners in CONTROL.

**Null Hypothesis**\
*No significant differences in performance will exist between learners in the IMPASSE and CONTROL conditions.*

## H1A \| Q1 ACCURACY

**Do Ss in the IMPASSE condition have a higher likelihood of producing a correct response to the first question?**

The graph comprehension tasks includes 15 questions completed in sequence. But the first question the reader encounters (Q1) is the most important, as it is their *first exposure* to the unconventional triangular coordinate system.

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Research Question     | Does the frequency of correct (vs) incorrect responses on the first question differ by condition? \[Is response accuracy independent of condition?\]                                                                                   |

```

A proportional bar chart visualizing the proportion of incorrect (vs) correct responses in each condition for each data collection modality (left/right facet) reveals that the pattern of responses appear the same regardless of the data collection modality. In both data collection sessions, the proportion of incorrect responses is much greater than the proportion of correct responses, regardless of condition (marginal probability of incorrect). In the impasse condition, the difference in proportions is smaller than the control condition (conditional probability of success in impasse; (i.e) There are more correct responses in the impasse condition than the control condition).

##### Inference

**We fit a logistic regression model to analyze the effect of experimental condition on probability of a correct answer on the first question. In this model, the effect of condition is statistically significant (z = 1.79, p = 0.04, *one-tailed*). The model predicts that the odds of a correct response on the first question in the *impasse condition* increase by nearly 120% (**$e^{beta_1}$ = 2.19, 95% CI \[1.08, 4.63\]) over the *control condition*.

*Equivalent statements:*

-   being in impasse condition increases log odds of correct response by 0.79 (over control)
-   being in impasse increases odds of correct response in impasse over control increases by factor of 2.22
-   probability of correct response in impasse predicted as 30%, vs only 16% in control condition

##### TODO

-   Are these residuals OK? I didn't think normally distributed residuals were an assumption for logistic regression.
-   interpretation/reporting of model fit?
-   sanity check correct interpretation of coefficients & reporting

##### Inference

**We fit a logistic regression model to analyze the effect of experimental condition on probability of a correct answer on the first question. In this model, the effect of condition is statistically significant (z = 2.63, p = 0.004, *one-tailed*). The model predicts that the odds of a correct response on the first question in the *impasse condition* increase by nearly 170% (**$e^{beta_1}$ = 2.69, 95% CI \[1.47, 5.11\]) over the *control condition*.

*Equivalent statements:*

-   being in impasse condition increases log odds of correct response by 0.99 (over control)
-   being in impasse increases odds of correct response in impasse over control increases by factor of 2.69
-   probability of correct response in control predicted as 28%, vs only 13% in the control condition

##### TODO UPDATE Inference

We fit a mixed-effect binomial logistic regression model with random intercepts for subjects and items; to investigate the effect of condition on test phase item accuracy. The model including a fixed effect of condition performed significantly better than an intercept-only baseline model (Ï‡2(4): 9.81, p \< 0.002); and the total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R2 = 0.74) and the part related to the fixed effects (marginal R2) is 0.02. Consistent with the pattern of results for the first question only, across all test-phase items, being in the impasse condition increases the odds of a correct response by a factor of 2.7 over the control condition $e^{\beta_1}$ = 2.69, 95% CI \[1.31, 5.811\], p \< 0.001.

##### TODO

-   sanity check interpretation
-   sanity check random effects structure : ITEM appropriate as random intercept? What does it mean to have two random intercepts?
-   DIAGNOSTICS: What in the world is happening with the normality of random effects plot? Do the fixed effects residuals need to be normally distributed?
-   Are there other plots or recommended diagnostics for mixed log regression
-   consider multiple regression with rt, sequence cluster, confidence, etc.
-   What else needs to be interpreted with respect to the item and subject random effects?
-   Double check: can't have condition by subject or item slope bc subjects are nested in conditions, not crossed

### SHIFT IN MODAL MASS

The Effect of Condition on Total Scaled Score can be described as a 'shift' in mass between the low and high modes of each distribution.

*First, we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as a Robust alternative to the t-test to test if the two distributions likely come from different populations.*
