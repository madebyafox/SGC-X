# Hypothesis Testing {#sec-SGC3A-hypotesting}

**TODO**\

-   clarify core questions being asked
-   update SGC3A main based on hypothesis organization
-   decision table for cummulative performance
-   review models already created in ARCHIVE?
-   explore response consistency

There are x questions we aim to answer :

\(1\) Does the experimental condition yield significantly better performance on the first question?

\(2\) Does the experimental condition yield significantly better performance overall?

## INITIAL PERFORMANCE

The graph comprehension tasks includes 15 questions completed in sequence. But the first question the reader encounters (Q1) is the most important, as it is their *first exposure* to the unconventional triangular coordinate system.

TODO: - does impasse yield different exploration behavior? (characterize mouse) - does impasse yield more time on task? (characterize response time ? number of answers then de-selected?)

TODO: Think about characterizing how variable the interpretations are across a participant. Do they form an interpretation and hold it constant? Or do they change question to question.

### Response Accuracy of First Question by Condition

#### Chi Square \| Accuracy \~ Condition

A proportional bar chart visualizing the proportion of incorrect (x =0) vs correct (x = 1) responses in each condition (right/left facet) for each data collection modality (top/bottom) reveal that the pattern of responses appear the same regardless of the data collection modality. In both data collection sessions, the proportion of incorrect responses is much greater than the proportion of correct responses, regardless of condition. In the impasse condition, the difference in proportions is smaller than the control condition (i.e. There are more correct responses in the impasse condition than the control condition).

```{r}
#| label: VIS-Q1ACC.by.COND-mosaic

#MOSAIC PLOT
vcd::mosaic(main="Accuracy on First Question by Condition (Both Modalities)",
            data = df, score_niceABS ~ condition, rot_labels=c(0,90,0,0),
            offset_varnames = c(left = 4.5), offset_labels = c(left = -0.5),just_labels = "right",
            spacing = spacing_dimequal(unit(1:2, "lines")))



#PRINT CONTINGENCY TABLE
title = "Proportion of Correct Responses On First Item (Both Modalities)"
item.contingency <-  df %>% dplyr::select(condition, score_niceABS) %>% table() %>% prop.table() %>% addmargins()
item.contingency %>% kbl (caption = title) %>% kable_classic()
```

A mosaic plot condition by response accuracy on the first question (across both data collection modalities) reveals the same pattern (the mosaic plot is an alternative visualization technique to the proportional bar chart). The relative size of condition boxes (111 vs 121) reflects that the sample is roughly evenly split across experimental conditions. The difference in size between 0 (incorrect) and 1 (correct) reflects that the proportion of correct responses (1) is greater in the impasse condition (121).

Next, we compute a contingency table and Pearson's Chi-Squared test for each data collection modality.

```{r}
#| label : CHISQR-Q1TRI.by.COND-LAB

df = df_items %>% filter(q==1) %>% filter(mode == "lab-synch")
CrossTable( x = df$condition, y = df$score_niceABS, fisher = TRUE, chisq=TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE)

```

**For the in-lab data collection** (n=126) the Pearson's Chi-squared test (of independence) indicates a relationship between response accuracy on the first question and experimental condition approaching statistical significance, $\chi^2$ (1) = 10.3, p = 0.07. Thus we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1. In this particular data sample, the odds ratio (Odds Ratio = 2.18, p = 0.055, 95% CI \[0.982, +Inf\]) indicates that the odds of producing a correct response on the first question were 2.18 times greater if a subject was in the impasse condition, than in the control condition .

```{r}
#| label : CHISQR-Q1TRI.by.COND-ONLINE

df = df_items %>% filter(q==1) %>% filter(mode == "asynch")
CrossTable( x = df$condition, y = df$score_niceABS, fisher = TRUE, chisq=TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE)

```

**For online data collection** (n=204), a Pearson's Chi-squared test (of independence) indicates a statistically significant relationship between response accuracy on the first question and experimental condition, $\chi^2$ (1) = 7.26, p = 0.009. Thus we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1. The odds ratio (Odds Ratio = 2.68, p = 0.005, 95% CI \[1.37, +Inf\]) indicates that the odds of producing a correct response on the first question were 2.68 times greater if a subject was in the impasse condition, than in the control condition .

```{r}
#| label : CHISQR-Q1TRI.by.COND-BOTH

df = df_items %>% filter(q==1) 
CrossTable( x = df$condition, y = df$score_niceABS, fisher = TRUE, chisq=TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE)

```

**Combining data across both sessions** (n=330), a Pearson's Chi-squared test suggests a statistically significant relationship between response accuracy on the first question and experimental condition, $\chi_2$ (1) = 10.3, p = 0.001. The sample odds ratio (2.46, p = 0.001, 95% CI \[1.37, 4.53\]) indicates that the odds of providing a correct response to the first question are 2.46 higher for subjects in the impasse condition than those in the control condition.

## CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE

*Overall* does the impasse condition affect performance on the graph comprehension task?

### Cumulative Score By Condition

Cumulative scores indicate the response accuracy by a particular participant across all discriminant items (n=13) in the graph comprehension task.

```{r}
#| label: VIS-SUBJECT-ABS
 
#VISUALIZE distribution of response accuracy across SUBJECTS

#HISTOGRAM
stats = df_subjects %>% group_by(condition, mode) %>% dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(s_ABS))
gf_density(~s_ABS, data = df_subjects) %>% 
  gf_facet_grid(condition~mode, labeller = label_both) %>% 
  gf_lims(x = c(0, 13)) %>% 
  gf_vline(data = stats, xintercept = ~mean, color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Cumulative Absolute Score",
       y = "proportion of subjects",
       title = "Subject Cumulative Score (Absolute)",
       subtitle = "Score distributions are comparable across modalities and different across conditions") + 
  theme_minimal()

```

**Does the IMPASSE condition yield higher scores?**

#### Linear Regression

To address this question we assess how much variance in cumulative (absolute) score is explained by experimental condition by utilizing OLS linear regression, predicting absolute score from condition.

```{r}
#| label: MODEL-cumulative-score-LAB

#SCORE predicted by CONDITION
m1 <- lm(s_ABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects %>% filter(mode=="lab-synch"))
paste("Model")
summary(m1)
paste("Partition Variance")
anova(m1)
paste("Confidence Interval on Parameter Estimates")
confint(m1)
# report(m1) #sanity check

```

**For in-lab data collection** an OLS linear regression predicting cumulative absolute score by experimental condition explains a statistically significant though small 7.5% variance in score (F(1,124) = 10.1, p \< 0.01). The estimated beta coefficient ($/beta$ = 2.76, 95% CI \[1.04, 4.48\]) predicts that participants in the impasse condition will on average score 2.76 points (21%) higher than those in the control condition.

```{r}
#| label: MODEL-cumulative-score-ONLINE

#SCORE predicted by CONDITION
m1 <- lm(s_ABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects %>% filter(mode=="asynch"))
paste("Model")
summary(m1)
paste("Partition Variance")
anova(m1)
paste("Confidence Interval on Parameter Estimates")
confint(m1)
#report(m1) #sanity check

```

**For the online replication**, an OLS linear regression model predicting cumulative absolute score by condition explains a statistically significant though small 5.5% of variance in absolute score (F(1,202) = 11.73, p \< 0.001). The beta coefficient for condition indicates that on average, participants in the IMPASSE group scored 2.3 points higher on the task than those in the control condition (CI\[0.97, 3.59\]).

::: callout-note
**From these models we can reasonably conclude that the impasse condition yielded a small but reliable improvement in performance across items in the graph reading task.**

**Model Diagnostics**

```{r}
#| label: DIAGNOSTICS-ABSCORE-LINEAR

check_model(m1)

```

#### Poisson Regression

The outcome variable absolute score is clearly not normal. As it represents the cumulative number of items a participant has answered correctly, we can consider it a type of *count*, (ie. count of the number of questions the participant got correct) and attempt to model it using a General Linear Model with the Poisson distribution (and the default log-link function).

```{r}
# library('fitdistrplus')
# plot(fitdist(df_subjects$s_ABS,"pois"))
# plot(fitdist(df_subjects$s_ABS,"norm"))
# plot(fitdist(df_subjects$s_ABS,"beta"))
# 
# 
# plotdist(df_subjects$s_ABS, histo = TRUE, demp = TRUE)
# descdist(df_subjects$s_ABS, discrete=FALSE, boot=500)


```

```{r}
#| label: MODEL-ABSCORE-POISSON

#SCORE predicted by CONDITION --> POISSON DISTRIBUTION
mp1 <- glm(s_ABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects %>% filter(mode=="lab-synch"), family = "poisson")
paste("Model")
summary(mp1)
paste("Partition Variance")
anova(mp1)
paste("Confidence Interval on Parameter Estimates")
confint(mp1)
report(mp1) #sanity check

```

```{r}
#| label: DIAGNOSTICS-ABSCORE-POISSON

check_model(mp1)

```

```{r}
#Which is a better fit? linear or poisson?

compare_performance(m1,mp1)

```
