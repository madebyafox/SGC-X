# Hypothesis Testing {#sec-SGC3A-hypotesting}

**TODO**

-   HURDLE MODEL? (mixture model w/ 0 + count)
-   consider zero-inflated (poisson or neg binom) with \_rt as predictor of count process and condition as predictor of excess zeros
-   review models already created in ARCHIVE?
-   explore response consistency

*The purpose of this notebook is test the hypotheses that determined the design of the SGC3A study.*

**Research Questions**

In SGC3A we set out to answer the following question: Does posing a mental impasse improve performance on the graph comprehension task?

**Experimental Hypothesis**\
*Learners posed with scenario designed to evoke a mental impasse will be more likely to correct interpret the graph.*

-   H1A \| Learners in the IMPASSE condition will score higher on the TEST Phase than learners in CONTROL.
-   H1B \| Learners in the IMPASSE condition will be more likely to correctly answer the first question than learners in CONTROL.
-   H1C \| Learners in the IMPASSE condition will spend more time on the first question than learners in CONTROL.

**Null Hypothesis**\
*No significant differences in performance will exist between learners in the IMPASSE and CONTROL conditions.*

**For (In Person)** an OLS linear regression predicting test-phase (% correct) by experimental condition explains a statistically significant though small 6% variance in accuracy (F(1,124) = 7.89, p \< 0.01). The estimated beta coefficient ($\beta$ = 0.20, 95% CI \[0.05, 0.35\]) predicts that participants in the impasse condition will on average score 20% higher than those in the control condition.

###### Inference

OLS Linear Regression on % correct in the TEST PHASE shows that condition explains a small but statistically significant amount of variance (impasse \> control). However, the model is a poor fit to the data: (1) the model predictions for each group are closer to the anitimode of each of distribution than the group modes, and (2) the distribution of residuals is not normal.

###### Inference

**For in person collection** OLS Linear Regression on % correct in the TEST PHASE shows that condition explains a small but statistically significant amount of variance (impasse \> control). However, the model is a poor fit to the data: (1) the model predictions for each group are closer to the anitimode of each of distribution than the group modes, and (2) the distribution of residuals is not normal, and the LM assumptions of homogeneity of variance (between groups) and homogeneity of error variance appears to be violated.

## H1B \| Q1 ACCURACY

The graph comprehension tasks includes 15 questions completed in sequence. But the first question the reader encounters (Q1) is the most important, as it is their *first exposure* to the unconventional triangular coordinate system.

TODO: - does impasse yield different exploration behavior? (characterize mouse) - does impasse yield more time on task? (characterize response time ? number of answers then de-selected?)

TODO: Think about characterizing how variable the interpretations are across a participant. Do they form an interpretation and hold it constant? Or do they change question to question.

| Research Question     | Does the frequency of correct (vs) incorrect responses on the first question differ by condition? \[Is response accuracy independent of condition?\]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

A proportional bar chart visualizing the proportion of incorrect (x =0) vs correct (x = 1) responses in each condition (right/left facet) for each data collection modality (top/bottom) reveal that the pattern of responses appear the same regardless of the data collection modality. In both data collection sessions, the proportion of incorrect responses is much greater than the proportion of correct responses, regardless of condition. In the impasse condition, the difference in proportions is smaller than the control condition (i.e. There are more correct responses in the impasse condition than the control condition).

item.contingency %>% kbl (caption = title) %>% kable_classic()
```

A mosaic plot condition by response accuracy on the first question (across both data collection modalities) reveals the same pattern (the mosaic plot is an alternative visualization technique to the proportional bar chart). The relative size of condition boxes (111 vs 121) reflects that the sample is roughly evenly split across experimental conditions. The difference in size between 0 (incorrect) and 1 (correct) reflects that the proportion of correct responses (1) is greater in the impasse condition (121).

Next, we compute a contingency table and Pearson's Chi-Squared test for each data collection modality.

Thus we have insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the odds ratio is equal to 1. In this particular data sample, the odds ratio (Odds Ratio = 2.18, p = 0.055, 95% CI \[0.982, +Inf\]) indicates that the odds of producing a correct response on the first question were 2.18 times greater if a subject was in the impasse condition, than in the control condition .

**Combining data across both sessions** (n=330), a Pearson's Chi-squared test suggests a statistically significant relationship between response accuracy on the first question and experimental condition, $\chi_2$ (1) = 10.3, p = 0.001. The sample odds ratio (2.46, p = 0.001, 95% CI \[1.37, 4.53\]) indicates that the odds of providing a correct response to the first question are 2.46 higher for subjects in the impasse condition than those in the control condition.

**Model equation** `r eq`

**For (In Person)** an OLS linear regression predicting response time on the first question by experimental condition explains a statistically significant though small 8% variance in accuracy (F(1,124) = 10.2, p \< 0.01). The estimated beta coefficient ($\beta$ = 14.43, 95% CI \[5.5, 23.4\]) predicts that participants in the impasse condition will spend on average 14 seconds more on the first question than those in the control condition.

### Test Phase Absolute Score (# questions)

#### Linear Regression

*LM on Test Phase absolute score **as number of questions**, rather than % correct.*

```{r}

#SCORE predicted by CONDITION
lm.1 <- lm(item_test_NABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects)
paste("Model")

check_model(lm.1)
```

#### Poisson Regression TODO

https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/poisson-regression/

The outcome variable absolute score is clearly not normal. As it represents the cumulative number of items a participant has answered correctly, we can consider it a type of *count*, (ie. count of the number of questions the participant got correct) and attempt to model it using a General Linear Model with the Poisson distribution (and the default log-link function).

```{r}
#POISSON

#SCORE predicted by CONDITION --> POISSON DISTRIBUTION
p.1 <- glm(item_test_NABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects, family = "poisson")
paste("Model")
summary(p.1)

```

#### Negative Binomial Regression

https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/negative-binomial-regression/ - overdispersed count data (variance much greater than mean)

```{r}
#NEGATIVE BIONOMIAL REGRESSION
# - https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/negative-binomial-regression/
# - Overdispersed Count variables

library(MASS)

nb.1 <- glm.nb(item_test_NABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects)
summary(nb.1)
report(nb.1)
check_model(nb.1)

#check model assumption
#assumes conditional means are not equal to conditional variances
#conduct likelihood ration test to compare and test [need poisson]
m3 <- glm(item_test_NABS ~ condition, family = "poisson", data = df_subjects)
pchisq(2 * (logLik(nb.1) - logLik(m3)), df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
#A large (+) log likelihood suggests that the negative binomial is more appropriate than the Poisson model


#EXPONENTIATE PARAMETER ESTIMATES
est <- cbind(Estimate = coef(nb.1), confint(nb.1))
#exponentiate parameter estimates
print("Exponentiated Estimates")
exp(est)
```

The variable condition has a coefficient of 0.67, (p \< 0.005). This means that for the impasse condition, the expected log count \# of questions increases by 0.67. By exponentiating the estimate we see that \# question correct rate for the impasse condition is nearly 2x that of the control condition.

#### Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Regression

https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/zinb/ count data that are overdispersed and have excess zeros

Zero-inflated negative binomial regression is for modelling count variables with excessive zeros, and especially when the count data are overdispersed (mean is much larger than variance). It can help account for situations where theory suggests that excess zeros are generated by 2 separate processes, one that includes the other count values, and the other that is just the zeros, and thus that the *excess* zeros can be modelled independently.

Total Absolute Score (# items correct) may fit this situation, as the data are overdispersed (variance much greater than the mean) and there are are very large number of zeros. It is theoretically plausible that these excess zeros (no answers correct) are the result of a different 'process' ... (i.e) little understanding and/or resistance to restructuring understanding of the coordinate system. However, I am not certain if it is plausible to suggest that the zeros themselves are the result of two different processes: (ie. perhaps trying to understand, and not trying to understand?) \<- this could maybe be disentangled by first question latency?

The model includes: - A logistic model to model which of the two processes the zero outcome is associated with - A negative binomial model to model the count process

```{r}
#| label: MODEL-TESTABS-ZINFNEGBINOM

library(pscl) #  for zeroinfl negbinomial

#ZERO INFLATED NEGATIVE BINOMIAL
zinb.1 <- zeroinfl(item_test_NABS ~ condition | condition , data = df_subjects, dist = "negbin")
#before the | is the count part, after the | is the logit model
paste("Model")
summary(zinb.1)
report(zinb.1)
performance(zinb.1)

# #EXPONENTIATE PARAMETER ESTIMATES
# est <- cbind(Estimate = coef(zinb.1), confint(zinb.1))
# #exponentiate parameter estimates
# print("Exponentiated Estimates")
# exp(est)

```

In the count model, the coefficient for the condition is very small, and not significant (suggesting it does not contribute to the count yielding process?).

In the zero-inflation model, the coefficient for the condition variable is -1.056 and statistically significant. This suggests that the log odds of being an excessive zero decrease by 1.06 if you are in the impasse condition (exponentiate it?)

**TODO come back to this and discuss further**\

#### HURDLE MODEL

https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-hurdle-models/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdle_model#:\~:text=A%20hurdle%20model%20is%20a,of%20the%20non%2Dzero%20values.

class of models for count data with both overdispersion and excess zeros;\
different from zero-inflated models where the excess zeros are theorized to arise from two different processes; in the hurdle model, there is a model for P(x=0) and a separate model for P(x!=0)

The model includes: - A binary logit model to model whether the observation takes a positive count or not. - a truncated Poisson or Negative binomial model that only fits positive counts

This allows us to model: (1) Does the student get *any* questions right? (2) How many questions does the student get right?

```{r}
library(pscl) #zero-inf and hurdle models 
library(countreg) #rootogram

h.1 <- hurdle(s_NABS ~ condition | condition , data = df_subjects,
              zero.dist = "binomial", dist = "poisson")

summary(h.1)

# h.2 <- hurdle(item_test_NABS ~ condition, data = df_subjects,
#               zero.dist = "binomial", dist = "negbin")
# 
# summary(h.2)



rootogram(h.1)
performance(h.1)

```

#### Model Comparison

```{r}
compare_performance(lm.1, p.1, nb.1, zinb.1)
```

For modelling test phase absolute score (# items correct) it seems that the zero inflated negative binomial model is the best fit according to R2 and AIC, however, I am not clear on the implications of the interpretation (non significant in count process, significant on logit process), and also not clear if \# items correct is truly a count process.
