*The purpose of this notebook is to explore item-level response data collected for study SGC-3: The Insight Hypothesis*

```{r SETUP, include=FALSE}

#IMPORT LIBRARIES 
library(tidyverse) #ALL THE THINGS 
library(kableExtra) #adv table rendering

```

First we import item-level data from the cleaned and wrangled R data structure file.

```{r IMPORT DATA}
df_items <- read_rds('data/sgc3a_items.rds')
```



### Question #2

```{r Q2-control}
#| warning: false

#define interpretation for each response
#NOTE: this is manually defined, based on inspecting answer options
  interpretation = c("ORTHOGONAL","TRIANGULAR","LINES-CONNECT","ORTHONGAL",
                     "LINES-CONNECT","","","(reference point)","ortho + satisfice","TRIANGULAR")

title <- "Frequency of Selected Response Options for Question #2 (Control Condition)"
df_items %>% filter(q == 2 & condition == 111) %>% group_by(response) %>% 
  summarise( count = n()) %>% arrange(-count) %>% cbind(interpretation) %>% 
  arrange(desc(interpretation)) %>% 
  kbl(caption = title) %>%  kable_classic() %>% 
  pack_rows("Triangular", 1, 2) %>% 
  pack_rows("Orthogonal", 3, 5) %>% 
  pack_rows("Lines-Connect", 6, 7) %>% 
  pack_rows("other", 8, 10) 

```

Again, we see that most subjects selected a response consistent with one of the identified interpretations. (note, when the question stem includes a data point rather than time as reference, we do not penalize respondents for selecting the reference data point *in addition* to an interpretation consistent response. For example, in this question, we do not penalize respondents for selecting option D, the reference point in the question. )

### Question #3

### Question #4

```{r Q4-control}
#| warning: false

#define interpretation for each response
#NOTE: this is manually defined, based on inspecting answer options
  interpretation = c("ORTHOGONAL","TRIANGULAR","orth-lines connect","BLANK","orth-lines connect",
                     "lines-connect","orthogonal","","","",
                     "","","","","","" )

title <- "Frequency of Selected Response Options for Question #4 (Control Condition)"
df_items %>% filter(q == 4 & condition == 111) %>% group_by(response) %>% 
  summarise( count = n())  %>% arrange(-count) %>% cbind(interpretation) %>% 
  arrange(desc(interpretation)) %>% 
  kbl(caption = title) %>%  kable_classic() %>% 
  pack_rows("Triangular", 1, 1) %>% 
  pack_rows("Orthogonal", 2, 5) %>% 
  pack_rows("Lines-Connect", 6, 6) %>% 
  pack_rows("other", 7, 16) 


```

In Question 4 we see more than one variant of an orthogonal interpretation emerge.

| If the subject calculates end time for each data point (using duration on the y axis), they find that an (incorrect) projection of point U 'end time' intersects with the (incorrect) orthogonal projection of 4:00PM. | Alternatively, some subjects selected points E and D which intersect with an orthogonal projection from 4:00pm. We call this an 'orthogonal-lines connect" strategy, because it (incorrectly) adapts the orthogonal procedure for finding events that *start* at 4:00pm in order to find those that *end* at 4:00pm, thus selecting any data point with an orthogonal intersection with 4:00pm. |

### Question #5

#NOTE: this is manually defined, based on inspecting answer options
  interpretation = c("ORTHOGONAL","TRIANGULAR","orth-satistice","BLANK","orth-satisfice",

```

TODO note the compelling cases of internal inconsistency (HJDE)

## Impasse Condition

We can compare these responses to those produced by participants in the experimental impasse condition (`condition` = 121).

```{r Q1-impasse}

#define interpretation for each response
#NOTE: this is manually defined, based on inspecting answer options
interpretation = c("BLANK","TRIANGULAR","partial-satisfice","LINES-CONNECT",
                   "partial-satisfice","partial-satisfice","partial-lines-connect",
                   "","partial-satisfice","partial-satisfice","partial-satisfice","partial-satisfice","")

title <- "Frequency of Selected Response Options for Question #1 (Impasse Condition)"
df_items %>% filter(q == 1 & condition == 121) %>% group_by(response) %>% 
  summarise( count = n()) %>% arrange(-count)  %>% cbind(interpretation) %>% 
  kbl(caption = title) %>%  kable_classic() 

```
