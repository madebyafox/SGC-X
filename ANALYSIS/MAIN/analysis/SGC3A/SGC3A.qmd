## INTRODUCTION {.unnumbered}

In Study 3A we explore a hypothesis that emerged from analysis of Study 2, namely that **presenting a learning with a situation that induces a state of impasse will increase the probability that learners experience a moment of insight, and in turn restructure their interpretation of the coordinate system.**

In the context of Study 2, an impasse state was (unintentionally) induced when the combination of question + data set yielded no available answer in the incorrect (cartesian) interpretation of the graph. In Study 3A, we test this hypothesis by comparing performance between a (treatment) group receiving impasse-inducing questions followed by normal questions, and a non-impasse control.

**To try the study yourself:**

-   [control condition](https://limitless-plains-85018.herokuapp.com/?study=SGC3A&condition=111&session=WEB-DEMO)

-   [impasse condition](https://limitless-plains-85018.herokuapp.com/?study=SGC3A&condition=121&session=WEB-DEMO)

### Hypotheses

H1. Learners posed with impasse-inducing questions will be *more likely* to correct interpret the graph.\
\
H0. Learners posed with impasse-inducing questions will be *no more likely* to correctly interpret the graph.

## METHODS

### Design

We employed a mixed design with 1 between-subjects factor with 2 levels (Scaffold: control, impasse) and 15 items (within-subjects factor).

Independent Variables:

-   B-S (Scaffold: control,impasse)
-   W-S (Item x 15)

Dependent Variables:

-   Response Latency : Time from stimulus onset to clicking 'Submit' button: time in (s)
-   Response Accuracy : Is the response triangular-correct?
-   (derived) Interpretation : With which interpretation of the graph is the subject's response on an individual question consistent?

### Materials

Stimuli consisted of a series of 15 graph comprehension questions, each testing a different combination of time interval relations, to be read from a Triangular-Model graph. @fig-sample. The list of questions can be found [here](static/stimuli/sgcx_questions.csv).

Note that across both control and impasse conditions, both the question, response options and graph structure were identical. The experimental manipulation (posing a mental impasse) was accomplished by changing the position of datapoints in the impasse-condition graph, such that for any given question, there was no available response option if the reader were to interpret the graph as cartesian (making an orthogonal rather than diagonal projection from the x-axis.)

*The green line indicates the ideal-scanpath to the correct (triangular) answer to the first question, and the red line indicates the (incorrect) orthogonal interpretation. In the IMPASSE figure (at right), there are no data points that intersect the red line.*

At right, the same graph is depicted, but datapoint A no longer intersects the orthogonal projection from the xaxis."}

### Procedure

Participants completed the study via a web-browser. Upon starting, they submitted informed consent, before reading task instructions. Participants were introduced to a scenario in which they were to play the role of a project manager, scheduling shifts for a group of employees. The schedule of the employees was presented in a TriangularModel (TM) graph, and they would be answering question about the schedule. Then participants completed a test block of 15 items. In the IMPASSE condition, the first five questions included an IMPASSE problem state. For participants in the CONTROL condition, the dataset was structure such that there was always an available 'orthogonal answer' for the first 5 questions. In both conditions, the remaining 10 questions were not structured as impasse. Following the test block, participants answered a free-response question about their strategy for reading the graph, followed by a demographic questionnaire and debrief.

### Sample

Data was collected by convenience sample of a university subject pool. Initial data (Fall 2017, Spring 2018) were collected in-person, with large groups of students simultaneously completing the study (independently) in a computer lab. In Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 we collected additional data to replicate results in a remote format (students completing the study asynchronously on their own computers).

## ANALYSIS

### Data Preparation

Before our data can be analyzed, data files from individual data collection periods must be harmonized into a common data format ([Section -@sec-SGC3A-harmonize]).

### Response Scoring

Because the graph comprehension task utilizes a Multiple-Response (MR) format (rather than simple multiple choice), the raw response data (the combination of answer options selected) for each question first need to be assigned a score. Approaches to scoring MR data and score transformations are derived in [Section -@sec-SGC3A-scoring].
