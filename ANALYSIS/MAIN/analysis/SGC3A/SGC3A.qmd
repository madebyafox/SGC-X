## INTRODUCTION {.unnumbered}

In Study 3A we explore a hypothesis that emerged from analysis of Study 2, that *presenting a learner with a situation that induces a state of impasse will increase the probability that learners experience a moment of insight, and in turn restructure their interpretation of the coordinate system.*

In the context of Study 2, an impasse state was (unintentionally) induced when the combination of question + data set yielded no available answer in the incorrect (cartesian) interpretation of the graph. In Study 3A, we test this hypothesis by comparing performance between a (treatment) group receiving impasse-inducing questions followed by normal questions, and a non-impasse control.

Posing a mental impasse
:::

**To try the study yourself:**

-   [control condition](https://limitless-plains-85018.herokuapp.com/?study=SGC3A&condition=111&session=WEB-DEMO)
-   [impasse condition](https://limitless-plains-85018.herokuapp.com/?study=SGC3A&condition=121&session=WEB-DEMO)

### Hypotheses

**Experimental Hypothesis:** *Learners posed with impasse-inducing questions will be more likely to correct interpret the graph.*

-   H1A \| Learners in the impasse condition will have better cumulative accuracy (get more questions correctly overall)
-   H1B \| Learners in the impasse condition will be more likely to correctly answer the first question
-   H1C \| Learners in the impasse condition will spend more time on the first question.

**Null Hypothesis:** *No significant differences in performance will exist between learners in the impasse and control conditions.*

**Exploratory Questions**

-   Consistency \| How consistent are learners in their interpretation of the graph? Do they adopt an interpretation on the first question and hold constant? Or do they change interpretations from question to question? Are there any interpretations that serve as 'absorbing states' (i.e. once encountered, the learner does not exist this state).
-   Time Course of Exploration \| What is the relationship between response accuracy (and interpretation) and time spent on each item?
-   Can exploration strategies be derived from mouse cursor activity?

## METHODS

### Design

We employed a mixed design with 1 between-subjects factor with 2 levels (Scaffold: control, impasse) and 15 items (within-subjects factor).

Independent Variables:

-   B-S (Scaffold: control,impasse)
-   W-S (Item x 15)

Dependent Variables:

-   Response Accuracy : Is the response triangular-correct?
-   Response Interpretation : (derived) With which interpretation of the graph is the subject's response on an individual question consistent?
-   Response Latency : Time from stimulus onset to clicking 'Submit' button: time in (s)

### Materials

Stimuli consisted of a series of 15 graph comprehension questions, each testing a different combination of time interval relations, to be read from a Triangular-Model graph. @fig-sample. The list of questions can be found [here](static/stimuli/sgcx_questions.csv).

![Sample Question (Q=1) for Graph Comprehension Task](static/stimuli/sample_task.png){#fig-sample fig-alt="picture of multiple select question on the left, accompanied by a triangular model graph on the right" fig-align="center"}

Note that across both control and impasse conditions, both the question, response options and graph structure were identical. The experimental manipulation (posing a mental impasse) was accomplished by changing the position of datapoints in the impasse-condition graph, such that for any given question, there was no available response option if the reader were to interpret the graph as cartesian (making an orthogonal rather than diagonal projection from the x-axis.)

*The green line indicates the ideal-scanpath to the correct (triangular) answer to the first question, and the red line indicates the (incorrect) orthogonal interpretation. In the IMPASSE figure (at right), there are no data points that intersect the red line. We hypothesize that this presents the reader with an obstacle, at which point they are forced to confront their interpretation of the coordinate system and (ideally) develop a new strategy.*

At right, the same graph is depicted, but datapoint A no longer intersects the orthogonal projection from the xaxis."}

### Procedure

Participants completed the study via a web-browser.

\(1\) Upon starting, they submitted informed consent, before reading task instructions.

\(2\) Participants were introduced to a scenario in which they were to play the role of a project manager, scheduling shifts for a group of employees. The schedule of the employees was presented in a TriangularModel (TM) graph, and they would be answering question about the schedule.

\(3\) Then participants completed an experimental block of 15 items.

(3A) The first five items in the task are defined as the SCAFFOLDING block. In the IMPASSE condition, the first five questions included an IMPASSE problem state. For participants in the CONTROL condition, the dataset was structure such that there was always an available 'orthogonal answer' for the first 5 questions.

(3B) The remaining 10 items are defined as the TESTING block. In both conditions, these questions were not structured as impasse (i.e. contained an available orthogonal answer)

\(4\) Following the experimental block, participants answered a free-response question about their strategy for reading the graph, followed by a demographic questionnaire and debrief.

### Sample

Data was collected by convenience sample of a university subject pool. Initial data (Fall 2017, Spring 2018) were collected in-person, with large groups of students simultaneously completing the study (independently) in a computer lab. In Fall 2021 and Winter 2022 we collected additional data to replicate results in a remote format (students completing the study asynchronously on their own computers).

## ANALYSIS

### Data Preparation

Data were collected via a custom web application and stored in a NoSQL database. The following exclusion criteria were applied during data cleaning:

-   completion status : "success" ; subject must have finished all parts of the study, including demographic questionnaire
-   session ID: \[in list\] ; subject must have been assigned to valid data collection session (discard testing and piloting data)
-   browser interaction violations \< 3; subject must have fewer than 3 violations of non-allowed browser interactions (i.e. resizing window, leaving browser tab or leaving fullscreen mode)
-   self-rated effort \> 2; subjects who reported, "not trying hard/rushing through questions" or "started out trying hard but giving up at some point" were excluded from analysis.
-   attention check ==TRUE ; subjects who failed to answer a mid-study attention check question (Graph Comprehension Task Question #6) are excluded

Before analysis, data files from individual data collection periods are harmonized into a common data format ([Section -@sec-SGC3A-harmonize]).

### Response Scoring

Because the graph comprehension task utilizes a Multiple-Response (MR) format (rather than simple multiple choice), the raw response data (the combination of answer options selected) for each question first need to be assigned a score. Approaches to scoring MR data and score transformations are derived in [Section -@sec-SGC3A-scoring].

### Hypothesis Testing

Experimental hypotheses are tested in [Section -@sec-SGC3A-hypotesting].

### Exploratory Analysis

Further data analyses are documented in [Section -@sec-SGC3A-exploration].
