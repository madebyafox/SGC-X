# Introduction {#sec-SGC2-introduction}

In Study Two we examine if scaffolding is effective in aiding untrained students to understand the Triangular Model (TM) graph. We know that students are unlikely to construct the correct interpretation of the TM without assistance. Guided by the results of the Study One Design Task, we created four scaffolds. We test the effectiveness of these scaffolds by seeking to replicate the Qiang et.al (2014) finding that after 20 minutes of video training, students perform faster and more accurately with the unconventional TM than the conventional Linear Model (LM). Will our participants show similar performance on the TM with scaffolds rather than formal instruction? Further, will engagement with the TM in a reading task be sufficient for students to reproduce the graph in a subsequent drawing task?

### Hypotheses

1.  Learners without scaffolding (control) will perform better with the LM than TM\
2.  Learners with (any form of) scaffolding will perform better with the TM than LM (replication of \[12\]).\
3.  Based on observations in Study One we expect that graph-order will act as a scaffold. Learners who solve problems with the LM graph first will perform better on the TM (relative to TM-first learners) as their attention will be drawn to the salient differences between the graphs.\
    <br>

## METHODS

### Design

We employed a 5 (scaffold: none-control, what-text, how-text, static image, interactive image) x 2 (graph: LM, TM) mixed design, with scaffold as a between-subjects variable and graph as a within-subject variable. To test our hypothesis that exposure to the conventional LM acts as a scaffold for the TM, we counterbalanced the order of graph-reading tasks (order: LM-first, TM-first). For each task we measured response accuracy and time. For the follow-up graph-drawing task, a team of raters coded the type of graph produced by each participant.\
<br>

### Materials

#### Scaffolds

For the first five questions of each graph-reading task, participants saw their assigned scaffold along with the designated graph. On the following ten questions, the scaffold was not present. Examples of each scaffold-condition for the TM and LM graphs are shown in the table above.

#### The Graph Drawing Task

In the <!--html_preserve--><a href="static/stimuli/drawing_task.pdf"> graph drawing task</a><!--/html_preserve--> participants were given a sheet of isometric dot paper and a table containing a set of 10 time intervals. Isometric dot paper equally supports the construction of lines at 0, 45 and 90 degrees, thus minimizing any biasing effects of the paper on the type of graph the participants chose to draw. Participants were directed to draw a triangular graph of the data ("like the triangle graph you saw in the previous task"), using the pencil, eraser and ruler provided.

### Procedure

Participants completed the study individually in a computer lab. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of five conditions which determined what additional information (scaffold) they received while solving the first five problems with each graph: no-scaffold (control), 'what' text, 'how'-text, static-image, and interactive-image. After a short introduction they continued to the first of two graph reading tasks (graph order counterbalanced). After completing the first graph reading task, they were introduced to the second scenario, and completed the second graph reading task with the remaining graph. Finally, participants completed the graph drawing task. They finished the study by completing a short demographic survey, and reading the debriefing text. The runtime of the entire study ranged from 20 to 60 minutes.

### Sample

Data was collected by convenience sample of a university subject pool. Data were collected in the Spring of 2017 with, in-person, with large groups of students simultaneously completing the study (independently) in a computer lab.
