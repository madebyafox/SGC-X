	abstract = {Multiple-True-False questions are one specific type of multiple-choice item that can be used to assess knowledge in written examinations. Within Multiple-True-False items, a number of statements within a single item are given, and each statement has to be marked separately as true or false. Various scoring methods for Multiple-True-False items exist and there is no consensus as to the ideal scoring method. The study aimed to systematically identify available scoring methods for Multiple-True-False items and to assess their usability and statistical parameters (i.e. available information included and expected chance scores from random guessing). Another objective was to examine the relation between examinees’ true knowledge and expected scoring results. Data presented in this manuscript may help educators make informed choices about the scoring method to be selected and corresponding pass marks required for testing a certain level of true knowledge of examinees.},

	abstract = {Intercorrelations among multiple true-false items were examined to determine to what extent each true-false option can be treated as independent. Results from 157 health science students and 170 medical students showed that correlations between true-false options associated with the same stem were from 2.6 to 7.0 times larger than those from different stems. This suggests that results from previous research indicating that each true-false option could be treated as an independent item cannot be generalized to other tests and examinee populations without supporting evidence. Four scoring methods were explored which varied chance success levels and scoring for partial knowledge. The results showed that scoring methods incorporating partial knowledge were more reliable and possessed greater concurrent and predictive validity than those minimizing chance success. Methods for computing reliability estimates were compared and suggestions were offered regarding practical use},
