The analysis notebooks consistute work done during winter and spring of 2022, prior to refactoring analysis using Quarto (.qmd) files so the entire body of dissertation work could be shared as a book/web respository.  .qmd files in the MAIN repository supercede these notebooks, but I am saving them as they also represent analysis paths explored and abandoned (including rescoring using partial [-1/n + 1/n])


DB Study3 comes from data collection completed in Fall of 2017, the first experimental run.
It seems there were some issues with the size of the response buttons leading to possible missing answers, as the students may have thought they were selecting an answer, but it was not recorded.

Replication in spring 2018 includes clarifications to the questions to mitigate language differences.
