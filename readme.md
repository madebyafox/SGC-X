Primary repository for SGC-related studies (Amy Fox PhD Dissertation @ UCSD)

Note: The same data collection framework was employed to collect data for multiple studies at the same time, so directories are primarily organized around *time period* rather than specific study, in accordance with the data processing pipeline.
